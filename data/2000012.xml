<AbstractNarration>This award provides three years of funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the semi-annual conference series "Brazos Analysis Seminar" 2020-2022, the first meeting of which will be held March 28-29, 2020 at Texas A&amp;M University. Subsequent meetings will rotate among University of Houston, Texas Christian University, University of Texas at Tyler, Baylor University, and Texas A&amp;M University. The Brazos Analysis Seminar will bring together analysts at academic institutions within the South-Central region of the United States on a regular basis to communicate their research, with a particular emphasis on providing an opportunity for young researchers and graduate students to meet, collaborate and disseminate their work on a regular basis during the academic year. The format for the seminar provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and junior investigators to present their work, start new collaborations, learn about the latest developments in modern analysis, and to advance their careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific topics of this conference series will  focus  on the analytic theory of  operator algebras and operator spaces and their connections to  harmonic analysis, ergodic theory, dynamical systems, and quantum information theory. These connections include free probability methods in the study of quantum groups, Fourier multiplier theory on noncommutative Lp spaces,  dynamical system methods and  K-theory methods in the classification of Câˆ—-algebras and von Neumann algebras,  etale groupoids, and inverse semigroups. In each meeting, there will be three plenary talks given by prominent experts, six contributed talks presented by three experts from the region and three upper-level PhD students. The goal is to keep both early-career and senior researchers in south-central institutions abreast of the latest major mathematical developments in noncommutative analysis, and to enhance and advance research on related topics. Additional information is available on the seminar website https://sites.google.com/site/brazosanalysisseminar.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
