<AbstractNarration>This project is primarily concerned with the mathematical theory of heat conduction. The subject matter lies at the intersection of geometric measure theory, partial differential equations, and harmonic analysis. In geometric measure theory, one studies geometric properties of sets via the behavior of some measure on that set, where the concept of "measure" generalizes the notions of length, area and volume. In this project, the kind of set that we consider is typically the boundary of some region in space, or of some evolving region in space-time.  Partial differential equations describe mathematically the conduction of heat, the propagation of waves, and many other physical phenomena. Harmonic analysis is a mathematical tool with which one extracts information by decomposing mathematical functions into fundamental constituent pieces. A principal goal of this project is to understand, in a quantitative way, how the geometry of a region influences the conduction of heat through the region, and across its boundary. This project will contribute to the development of the US workforce through the training of graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three main areas of focus: 1) the Neumann Problem. The PI plans to solve the Neumann problem for Laplace's equation, with p-integrable data, in domains satisfying a quantitative, scale invariant version of a measure theoretic condition which is equivalent to the existence of a measure-theoretic outer unit normal at almost every boundary point; thus, the condition is natural for the Neumann problem, and may be sharp. Eventually, the PI seeks to characterize geometrically the domains in which such solvability is possible. 2) Parabolic quantitative rectifiability. At present, the theory of quantitative rectifiability in the time-evolutive parabolic setting is quite rudimentary in comparison to the rich theory available in the steady-state elliptic setting.  In recent work of the PI and co-authors, elliptic quantitative rectifiability has played a central role in the characterization of those domains for which the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation is solvable. The PI expects that the proposed work would be a first step towards an analogous characterization in the parabolic case. 3) The Kato square root problem for non-divergence form elliptic operators.  The solution of the square root problem for divergence form elliptic operators has enabled significant progress in the theory of boundary value problems for divergence form equations.  As a first step towards opening up the analogous theory in the non-divergence setting, the PI proposes to treat the Kato problem for non-divergence elliptic operators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The goal of this project was to study certain problems in the theory of Partial Differential Equations ("PDE"). A primary focus of the project was to develop the underlying geometric foundations needed to understand the interplay between PDE theory and geometry, in the context of heat conduction. In the latter setting, it is the geometry of space-time that is relevant. More precisely, the PI seeks to characterize the geometry of space-time regions in which one can solve the Dirichlet problem (or initial-Dirichlet problem) for the heat equation: i.e., to determine the temperature, at points in space and time, inside the region, given the temperature distribution at points on the perimeter (the boundary) of the region, and to do so when this boundary data is allowed to be singular (that is, without imposing a quantitative upper bound on the maximum temperature on the boundary).   Much of the corresponding theory has already been developed, some of it by the PI and collaborators, in the steady-state setting, i.e., for regions in space in which the temperature distribution is in an equilibrium state, not varying with time. In the steady-state case, work of the PI showed that the right geometric condition on the boundary is that it be rectifiable in a quantitative sense, that is, approximable by planes in a quantitatively precise, scale-invariant way.   Under the auspices of the project, the PI has developed an analogous theory of quantitative rectifiabilty in the space-time setting, and has begun to apply that theory to certain problems of free boundary type, in which the information about the geometry of the zero set of a non-negative solution to the heat equation (i.e., the set of points where the solution equals zero), can be gleaned from quantitative information about the flux (the rate of heat flow) across this zero set. It turns out that such considerations are closely related to the aforementioned problem of understanding the geometry of space-time regions in which the Dirichlet problem is solvable, with singular boundary data.   In addition, the project contributed to the training of young researchers: during the course of the project, the PI supervised 5 Ph.D. students, 2 of whom remain currently enrolled, and 3 of whom have now graduated. All of these students worked on Ph.D. thesis problems related to the goals of the project.     Last Modified: 07/07/2024       Submitted by: StevenCHofmann]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
