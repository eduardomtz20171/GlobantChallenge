<AbstractNarration>This project will study the dynamics of the Schrodinger operator that describes the wave function or state function of a quantum mechanical system. The principal investigator  will develop fundamental tools to understand many types of phenomena in physics and chemistry, such as the quantum Hall effect, spin, crystals and  quasicrystals. In particular, the project focuses on the conductance, transport, and localization-diffusion in both quasiperiodic and disordered media. The development of the rigorous theory is expected to have many applications, including to quantum information theory and semiconducting materials. The project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and supports related outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at studying several topics in areas spanning mathematical physics, dynamical systems, harmonic analysis, geometric analysis, and algebraic geometry. The Principal Investigator will focus on transitions, hierarchical structures of eigenfunctions, quantum dynamics and spectral gaps for one dimensional quasiperiodic operators and further explore multifrequency and higher dimensional cases. The research will combine methods from algebraic geometry with tools from analysis to study the (ir)reducibility of Bloch, Fermi, and Floquet varieties arising from  periodic elliptic operators. In the area of geometric analysis, the project emphasizes using piecewise constructions, gluing techniques, and the compact perturbation theory to investigate the transition of singular spectra and the generic phenomena of Laplacians on noncompact complete manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Intellectual merit:Our project focused on exploring various topics in mathematical physics, leading to several exciting breakthroughs.1.  We tackled a longstanding question about Fermi and Bloch varieties, important objects in the study of periodic operators. Since the 1980s, it was conjectured that these varieties are always irreducible. We achieved a significant breakthrough by completely solving this problem using a novel blend of analytical and theoretical approaches.2.   We introduced a new concept called Fermi isospectrality, a type of inverse problem, and established several rigidity theorems. These theorems provided solutions to two major open problems that had remained unsolved for about 40 years.3.   Borg's theorem in one dimension states that a periodic potential is constant if and only if there are no spectral gaps. However, this does not extend to higher dimensions due to frequent overlaps of spectral gaps. We confirmed a conjecture related to the geometric version of Borg's theorem in any dimension using advanced tools from algebraic geometry, complex analysis, and spectral analysis. 4.  We explored the arithmetic properties of frequency and phase in quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators. Our findings showed that the distribution of resonances plays a critical role in the dynamics of these operators. We disproved a longstanding conjecture from the 1990s and proposed a new approach to studying Green's functions, proving another major conjecture about the arithmetic spectral transition.5. Nonlinear Random Schr\"odinger Equations: Using semi-algebraic geometry and the CWB method, we studied nonlinear random Schr\"odinger equations. This led to a significant result for non-integrable systems in any dimension, known as a KAM-type persistence result.  Broader Impact:During the grant period, three graduate students and one postdoctoral researcher received valuable training.The PI launched an ongoing research initiative called "Spectral Theory of Differential Operators" (STODO), completing four REU research projects and training 12 undergraduate students.The PI co-founded PReMa (Program for Research in Mathematics) for high school students, mentoring a  research project.The grant also supported the TAMU Math Circle, where the PI has been an organizer since 2019, fostering mathematical interest and skills among young students.
