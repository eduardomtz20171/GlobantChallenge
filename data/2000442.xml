<AbstractNarration>Keeping computers and information systems secure is a critical need and a major challenge. Thus, business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches. The growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have the knowledge and skills to protect digital infrastructure. This project will provide opportunities to broaden participation in the cybersecurity workforce by educating technicians to meet the evolving needs of the cybersecurity field and by strengthening the pipeline from high school to college to employer. This project will build on the results of Miami Dade College's prior NSF-funded project (DUE-1800958), which focused on building the capacity of college faculty in cybersecurity, developing a College Credit Certificate and a two-year Associate of Science degree in cybersecurity, and creating a pathway to these credentials for first-time-in-college and nontraditional students. The new project will focus on strengthening the relationship with high schools to improve the pipeline of students to the college's cybersecurity programs and supporting the retention, graduation, and job placement of students in the Associate of Science in Cybersecurity program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's objectives are to strengthen the pipeline from high school to college-level cybersecurity degree programs and to increase students' employability by aligning their learning with employer-informed technical and soft-skill competencies embedded in structured, applied learning experiences. Activities will include implementing an applied cybersecurity curriculum across partner high schools in the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, providing professional development for high school teachers, offering dual-enrollment courses for partner high schools, hosting cybersecurity summer camps for high school students, collaborating with business/industry partners to place students in internships and jobs, developing a competency checklist and a sample internship plan to guide employers and students, and providing academic success coaching to help students complete the Associate of Science in Cybersecurity program. The project evaluation will specifically examine strategies for recruiting high school students into cybersecurity, especially students from groups that are not yet equitably represented in STEM careers.  Evaluation will also include measures of high school teachersâ€™ preparation for teaching cybersecurity and the preparedness of the students who move into cybersecurity positions at local companies.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Project Outcomes Report    Award Title: Advancing Strategies in Cybersecurity Education and Career Development    Director/PI: Diego Tibaquira, Principal Investigator, Nelly Delessy, Co-Principal Investigator, Manuel Perez, Co-Principal Investigator    Federal Award ID: 2000442    This NSF-funded project successfully increased the number of underrepresented minorities entering the cybersecurity workforce by strengthening and expanding the pipeline from high school  to college  to employer and developing a blueprint that can be replicated by other Hispanic and Minority-Serving Institutions.    Objective 1: Strengthening the Pipeline from High School to College-Level Cybersecurity Degree Programs    To address the growing need for a robust cybersecurity workforce, the project implemented targeted strategies to create seamless pathways for students transitioning from high school to college-level cybersecurity programs. Key accomplishments include:    Professional Development for High School Teachers and Curriculum Alignment: High school teachers participated in a cybersecurity mentorship program that paired them with college instructors to develop high school curricula aligned with college -level curriculum. Over the course of the grant, 16 high school teachers participated in the mentorship program.  Dual Enrollment Opportunities: Dual enrollment programs were established, enabling high school students to enroll and earn college credit towards a college credit certificate or associate in science degree. Over the course of the grant, 97 high school students participated in these dual enrollment opportunities.  Cybersecurity Summer Program: High school students engaged in cybersecurity summer programs where they engaged in hands-on learning and attended educational workshops. Students were provided with the opportunity to earn the Certified Secure Computer User (CSCU) certification and learn about cybersecurity career opportunities. Over the course of the grant, 116 high school students attended the summer program and 60 students self-reported having earned the Certified Secure Computer User certification.

Key results include:    Industry Partnerships: The Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) consisting of 22 cybersecurity industry leaders and professionals informed curriculum development, student engagement and employability. Established during year one of the project, the BILT met regularly to review and discuss industry alignment of cybersecurity knowledge and skills with the colleges existing cybersecurity curriculum. Representatives from BILT, faculty, cybersecurity subject matter experts, including representatives from the National CyberWatch Center convened to develop a Cybersecurity Applied Learning Competency Checklist. The checklist identifies technical and soft skills students develop as part of applied learning experiences. The checklist is reviewed and updated before the end of each academic year for accuracy with cybersecurity positions.  Employer Engagement Opportunities: Representatives from the BILT and other cybersecurity professionals provided guest lectures within cybersecurity classes on topics such as Risk Management, Cybersecurity Threats, and Incident Response. In addition, Miami Dade College hosted annual cyber day events where 200 cybersecurity high school students attended presentations and engaged cybersecurity professionals from companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Fortinet, and others.      Objective 3: Expanding Academic Pathways for Underrepresented Minorities    To further address the underrepresentation of minority students in cybersecurity and address the demand for a higher educated workforce, the project developed a baccalaureate degree program in cybersecurity in 2021. The program was built in conjunction with the BILT following the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education framework and NSA guidelines.    Launched during year one of the project, the baccalaureate degree program continues to experience remarkable growth, with nearly 250 students currently enrolled in the program and more than 600 students enrolled since its inception. This growth reflects the program's strong alignment with industry needs, its emphasis on hands-on, applied learning, and its commitment to serving underrepresented minorities.    The cybersecurity baccalaureate degree program is proud to reflect the diversity of our community, with a student body that is 75% Hispanic, 17% Black, Non-Hispanic, 4% White, Non-Hispanic, and 4% Asian and other ethnicities. This demographic composition demonstrates our success in creating an inclusive and supportive environment that attracts underrepresented groups to pursue careers in cybersecurity.    Lastly, Miami Dade College received validation from the National Security Agency (NSA)for the baccalaureate in cybersecurity through 2029. Miami Dade College is the first institution in Florida to offer both associate and bachelors degree programs in cybersecurity validated bythe NSA.      Broader Impacts    This project has had a transformative impact on the cybersecurity education ecosystem, particularly for underrepresented communities. By strengthening the pipeline from high school to college, enhancing student employability, and expanding academic pathways, the project has:    Increased access to high-quality cybersecurity education for underserved populations, contributing to greater diversity in the workforce.  Improved alignment between education and industry needs, ensuring graduates are workforce-ready and competitive.       Last Modified: 12/30/2024       Submitted by: ManuelPerez]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
