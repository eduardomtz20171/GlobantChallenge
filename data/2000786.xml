<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[A critical shortage in skilled machining technicians exists across the nation, including in Utah's Bear River region.  Factors that contribute to this shortage include retirements, low unemployment rates, and the changing skills that workers need because of innovation in the manufacturing sector.  This project aims to increase the quality, capacity, and number of the next generation of skilled machinists in the Bear River Region.  To achieve this goal, the project will design a new streamlined Machining Technology certificate aligned to industry needs for more Computer Numerical Control (CNC) experience.  CNC uses computers and software to control machines, such as milling machines, lathes, and cutters.  It is a technology that is increasingly important in manufacturing.  The new Machining Technology certificate will be co-developed with industry partners.  It will focus on engaging and supporting students through real world, problem-based machining projects.  The project intends to acquire new equipment and to provide additional faculty training to prepare new workers from high school for the advanced manufacturing workforce, as well as to upskill local incumbent machinists.   In this way, it will contribute to the national need for a highly skilled technological workforce for advanced manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will align the Machining Technology program with local industry needs by including certification in innovative advanced manufacturing technologies, such as 5-axis CNC machines, programmable Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), and robotics.  By working with area high schools, the project intends to serve as a model for how applied technical colleges and secondary schools can collaborate to strengthen awareness of high-paying careers in advanced manufacturing, as well as how the relevant stackable credentials can support a pathway towards college. The project will disseminate newly designed industry courses, recruitment strategies, and outcomes at local and regional meetings, such as the Utah System of Technical Colleges Presidents meeting, and at national meetings, including the Advanced Technological Education principal investigator meeting.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

In the third year of the grant, Bridgerland integrated a donated Romer Arm into the program to complement the CMM. In addition to allowing students to gain knowledge and skills with advanced machining concepts, these new machines also eased the bottleneck of students waiting to complete multi-axis machining and geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) projects.   Program Streamlining - Bridgerlands Machining Department focused on redesigning the existing curriculum to be more aligned with industry needs.

Advanced Industry Courses - Bridgerlands Machining Department developed and delivered advanced industry courses in multi-axis machining and coordinate measure machines (CMMs). This generated a new pathway for entry-level machinists to upskill from machine operators into more technical jobs.   Recruitment - To increase recruitment, Bridgerlands Machining Department: a) conducted annual industry tours of local manufacturers with high school counselors and teachers, b) created partnerships with local high school teachers where we developed custom curriculum for their machines that led directly to BTECH's curriculum, and c) filmed and disseminated two machining industry tour videos.   Retention - To increase retention, Bridgerlands Machining Department: a) conducted annual industry tours of local manufacturers with high school students, and b) hosted an annual machining open house for high school students and their parents.   Professional Development - To upskill faculty in advanced machining topics, Bridgerlands Machining Department engaged in the following professional development activities: a) three Bridgerland instructors were certified in all of the advanced CNC courses at Vincennes University (including 5th-axis), b) one Bridgerland instructor was certified in PC-DMIS training, c) one Bridgerland instructor was certified in Fanuc Basic Programming and Fanuc Advanced Programming, and d) two Bridgerland instructors completed Polyworks training.   Over the life of the grant, these activities contributed to the following outcomes:     Program enrollment of high school students, certificate-seeking adult students, and incumbent students increased by 40.28%.     Retention of high school students into the adult certificate program increased by 33.62%.     Program completion of certificate-seeking students increased by 88.24%. In the final two years of the grant (i.e., excluding Covid-19 years), the number of certificate completers has increased by 152.94%     Certificate-seeking student dropouts decreased by 34.15%.     The pace of curriculum completion of certificate-seeking students increased by 37%.     Students taking a job before completing the certificate decreased by 58.33%.     *Comparisons are made between 6-year pre-grant averages (2014-2020) and 4-year grant averages (2021-2024).   This project made a significant impact on the capacity and quality of machining technicians statewide by directly impacting high school and college students, Bridgerland Technical College, career and technical educators in the region, and our industry partners. The benefits to students were: (1) improved curriculum, (2) higher retention rates, (3) access to a pathway into a career in machining technology, and (4) strong connections to local industry leaders.
