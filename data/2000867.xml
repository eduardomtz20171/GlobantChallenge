<AbstractNarration>Technologies involving robotics/automation have become prevalent in US manufacturing and service sectors.  Business leaders who adopt these technologies must prioritize cybersecurity to ensure the safety and security of their cyber-physical systems.  As a result, the interrelated areas of robotics/automation and cybersecurity are vital to US manufacturers.  This project will create an Advanced Technological Education (ATE) Coordination Network that includes community colleges with active ATE projects, Manufacturing Extension Partnerships, Manufacturing USA Institutes, and the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education.  The goal of this Coordination Network is to increase members’ understanding of the knowledge and skills required to operate and maintain connected machines securely in a manufacturing setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through workshops, virtual communication, and other modalities, this Coordination Network intends to facilitate the sharing of best practices about how to develop community college students’ knowledge and skills in robotics/automation and cybersecurity.  It will also promote awareness of organizations and resources that connect students to work-based learning opportunities. This Coordination Network will connect community college students to potential employers in the Manufacturing Extension Parternships client base.  By establishing connections and nurturing relationships among members, it is expected that the efforts of the Coordination Network will create synergies that magnify and broaden the impact of individual efforts.  The Coordination Network's web portal will make education and training materials available to non-members.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The main outcome of this coordination network project was the network itself. Those engaged in the network include community college faculty and administrators, Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) representatives, workforce development officers from two Manufacturing USA Innovation Institutes, and the director of the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE). While the project focused on developing technician training at the convergence of robotics/automation and cybersecurity, building this training by engaging individuals from these organizations enabled the enhancement of relationships between community colleges and MEPs across seven states. It also led to several new partnerships and collaborations across coordination network members.   A second outcome of the project was the development of a micro-credential called the Cyber4RAM (RAM = robotics/automation/mechatronics) digital badge. This micro-credential is available via a no-fee learning management system, making it accessible to all US learners. The 11 modules of the micro-credential are focused on 11 of the NICE competencies that tie back to advanced manufacturing. The goal of the micro-credential is to build cyber awareness among technicians working in robotics/automation/mechatronics. More information on the Cyber4RAM digital badge (micro-credential) is available here: https://ncmep.org/tracks-cn/badge/.   In terms of broader impacts, the network itself has impacted learners across seven states (NC, SC, IL, MI, VA, PA, OH) via new collaborations with industry and with others in the coordination network. Additionally, the micro-credential has been earned by 97 learners, potentially better positioning them for employment in advanced manufacturing. Participation by two of the Manufacturing USA Innovation Institutes provided all coordination network members with opportunities to learn more about the Manufacturing USA program and to potentially partner with an Institute on a grant or other collaborative effort.
