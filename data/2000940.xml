<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of graduate students, postdocs, and other early-career mathematicians in the Twenty-Third Riviere-Fabes Symposium, held at the University of Minnesota on April 24-26, 2020. The award gives junior researchers, researchers who are members of underrepresented groups, and researchers without other sources of funding a chance to attend and participate in this conference, thus helping to promote the future generation of scientists working in mathematical analysis.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The symposium focuses on recent developments in the field of analysis, with this year's program having a particular focus on the analysis of partial differential equations (Navier-Stokes, Schroedinger, elliptic, dispersive, porous media equations, optimal regularity).  More information can be found on the symposium web page: https://math.umn.edu/riviere-fabes-symposium/riviere-fabes-2020&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
