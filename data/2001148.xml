<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for the thirteenth “AIMS Conference on Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations, and Applications.” The event will take place at Peachtree Westin Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia, June 4-9, 2020. This series of biennial conferences has a 26-year history; it is organized under the American Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS). The conference has focus in the growing field of analysis and applied analysis with emphasis on dynamical systems, differential equations, and applications. The conference will foster international collaborations between researchers in these fields. It features a large number of presentations by graduate students and female mathematicians and scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While modern mathematics now encompasses a vast range of topics, dynamical systems and differential equations have retained their central role because of the wide variety of applications ranging from the traditional areas of physics and engineering to the more recently developed and growing applications in biology, chemistry, ecology, physiology, economics and finance. Thus, the study of differential equations and dynamical systems has been a core component in our understanding of many natural phenomena. The program includes over 90 special sessions, that cover a variety of topics such as: data science, Navier-Stokes equations and fluid mechanics, topological and variational methods, mathematics of chemotaxis, biological systems analysis, progress on the n-body problem, and stochastic partial differential equations, among others.  More information on the conference can be found at the conference website: http://aimsconference.org/conferences/2020/index.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
