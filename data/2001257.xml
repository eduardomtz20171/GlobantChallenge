<AbstractNarration>This mathematics research project naturally sits at the intersection of representation theory and geometry. Representation theory is a branch of mathematics studying symmetries of mathematical objects and structures. Methods from geometry have been very successful in answering questions in representation theory. The main goal of the project is to study open questions in representation theory using geometric methods. Specifically, the investigator plans to use and develop geometric tools to attack several longstanding problems in the study of representations of Lie groups, Higgs bundles and representations of fundamental groups, and the Langlands program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In more detail, the research centers on three projects: (1) Hitchin morphisms for higher dimensional varieties, (2) real quasi-maps and applications, and (3) nonlinear Fourier transforms and the Braverman-Kazhdan program. In project (1), the investigator will develop the theory of Hitchin morphisms for higher dimensional varieties and apply it to the study of the Simpson correspondence. This project is closely related to deep questions in invariant theory, higher-dimensional algebraic geometry, and representations of fundamental groups. In project (2), the investigator will explore the geometric structure of real quasi-maps and establish applications to the study of representation theory of real groups, the Kostant-Sekiguchi correspondence, and Springer theory for symmetric spaces. In project (3), the investigator will study the Braverman-Kazhdan approach to meromorphic continuation and functional equations of automorphic L-functions. Based on results on nonlinear Fourier transforms and the Braverman-Kazhdan conjecture in the finite field and D-modules setting, the project aims to construct nonlinear Fourier kernels in the local fields setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This mathematics research project naturally sits at the  intersection of representation theory, geometry and topology. Representation  theory is a branch of mathematics studying symmetries of mathematical  objects and structures. An important and interesting research area in representation theory is called the Langlands program, a web of far-reaching conjectures about connections between symmetries of numbers and symmetries in geometry, proposed by Robert Langlands in the late 60s. Methods from geometry and topology have been very successful  in answering questions in representation theory. The main goal of the  project is to study open questions in representation theory, such as the Langlands program, using  geometric and topological methods.       The PI and his collaborators discovered new connections between different types of geometry and developed new geometric and topological tools to  resolve several open questions and conjectures in representation theory, including real groups and symmetric varieties (stratified homeomorphism between real and symmetric matrices and derived geometric Satake equivalence for real groups), invariant theory (reduceness conjecture for d-commuting schemes),  and the Langlands  program (the Braverman-Kazhdan conjecture and the stable center conjecture).

Many worthy examples of the projects are usually related to combinatorics, complex algebraic surfaces, geometry and topology of nilpotent orbits or theory of perverse sheaves, making them ideal problems for beginning students.        The PI is currently advising several graduate students at University of Minnesota working on representation theory, number theory, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry.
