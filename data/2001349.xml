<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator's research explores the connections between three of the central concepts in algebra: groups, fields, and varieties. Groups are symmetry types; for instance, all bilaterally symmetric animals share a symmetry group, which is different  from the symmetry group of a starfish.  Fields are systems of numbers which can be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided; for instance, the usual real numbers form a field, but the rational numbers, which can be expressed as fractions, form a smaller field of particular interest to number theorists.  Varieties are systems of simultaneous equations in a number of variables.  The PI is trying to understand the deep connections between these three concepts.  For instance, simple groups, the building blocks for all finite groups, can almost always be expressed essentially as the points of a variety over a finite field. Varieties determine fields whose symmetry groups have been of interest in mathematics for more than 200 years, when Gauss gave a compass and straightedge construction for the regular 17-gon. This project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students working with the PI on these questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, this project involves using group theory to describe the images of Galois representations arising either from varieties or from automorphic forms.  Problems of this kind can often be approached via by what might be termed the "inverse problem" in invariant theory, recognizing an algebraic group from data about its representation category.  Group theory and algebraic geometry can be applied together to analyze the Galois action on Mordell-Weil groups of abelian varieties over Galois extensions. In a different direction, the project involves using algebraic geometry, alone or in combination with character-theoretic methods, to solve problems about finite simple groups. In particular, these tools can be applied to investigate word maps, defined by elements in free groups or related objects such as surface groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Intellectual Merit    My project belongs to the subject of group theory, which is the abstract study of symmetry in mathematics. My work sometimes concerns symmetries of particular abstract objects, such as number fields (systems of numbers, where arithmetic makes sense), or things which are more concrete, like the state spaces of quantum computers. But beyond these kinds of specific situations, group theory is interesting as a study in itself, and study of the possible types of symmetries has its own depth and mystery.    The simplest building blocks in finite group theory, the finite simple groups, have now been classified as a result of a huge effort by many mathematicians, covering perhaps 10,000 journal pages. However, our understanding of the individual finite simple groups is far from complete. The most important information about a given finite group is captured in a table of numbers, called the character table of the group. Probability theory is a powerful tool in group theory, but unexpectedly large entries in a character table cause trouble when one tries to use its methods. The most important outcome of this project is that my coworkers and I have developed new and improved methods to show that such large entries don't exist in character tables of finite simple groups. We have used these estimates to solve a number of longstanding problems. This work has been published in a series of papers in refereed journals (including 2024 papers in the celebrated journals Inventiones Mathematicae and Annals of Mathematics) and presented in conferences and seminar talks, including an invited talk at the quadrennial International Congress of Mathematicians.    Broader Impacts          Although my project was basic research, with no immediate practical end in view, the circle of ideas to which it belongs has found significant applications in the recent past. Indeed, some of my own past work has been applicable, especially my papers on quantum computation, statistical attacks on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange (a widely used cryptographic protocol), and efficient algorithms for packet routing in certain types of networks.          My project was also a source of motivation for thesis problems for my Ph.D. students. During the time of the grant, five students received Ph.Ds from the mathematics department of Indiana University under my supervision, and I currently have six doctoral students (including three women).    I have also recently restarted the Bloomington Math Circle, a math enrichment program for students in grades 3-6 from the Bloomington, Indiana area.
