<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Only 36 areas on earth contain almost half of the world’s plant diversity. Biodiversity hotspots occupy only 2.3% of the earth’s land surface but harbor a high proportion of endemic species and house most undescribed plant diversity. An important biotic component of biodiversity hotspots include plants with unusual morphologies, such as succulence, carnivory, and epiphytism. These plants are highly adapted to live in extreme environments but face serious threats of extinction due to changing climate and land use regimes. This project partners the Herbarium at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden (RSA) with the Endless Forms Project, a Thematic Collections Network (TCN) involving 17 institutions aimed at digitizing nearly 2 million herbarium specimens from 15 plant families with unusual adaptations. Collections targeted for this project are emblematic of the unique strengths of RSA and will add immeasurably to the Endless Forms TCN. This partnership fills an important gap by adding 70,100 herbarium specimens representing all families, some of which are especially diverse (cacti, agave, spurge) in California, a world biodiversity hotspot. Digitization will promote scientific investigation and public understanding of these potentially imperiled plants, and through public databases, will provide access to a rich source of specimen data. Graduate and undergraduate students will make up 90% of the workforce and participate in all aspects of the project. This project will enhance RSA’s existing internship program through increased participation of students from Hispanic Serving Institutions in the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. Through coordinated efforts with California Polytechnic University, Pomona (a Hispanic Serving Institution), undergraduate students will barcode specimens as partial fulfillment of course objectives. An exhibit will highlight plants of the Endless Forms project, including digitization activities and student participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding of the Endless Forms TCN was based on the unique value of digitizing plants that exhibit extreme morphologies, such as succulence, carnivory, and epiphytism, that can be used increase our understanding of how these plants have adapted to extreme environments and how changing climate regimes may impact future distributions. This project will add immeasurably to the Endless Forms TCN’s endeavor with the digitization of 70,100 unique specimens held at the RSA Herbarium. Important and TCN-relevant collections for the 15 families with unusual morphologies included for digitization are well represented in the RSA Herbarium, both in geographic breadth and taxonomic diversity, and owe significantly to the contributions of several noteworthy researchers affiliated with RSA who specialize on these plants. Digitization of these specimens will result in high-resolution images and georeferenced collection locations that will enable the potential discovery of species new to science, new distribution and phenology data, and increased access to a rich source of specimen data currently unavailable to the research community, students, and the public. Data capture, efficient workflow development, and dissemination of data will adhere to established guidelines as specified by the Endless Forms TCN. A large cadre of students at different levels in their academic career will participate in all aspects of the project, including data entry, imaging, and georeferencing. All data resulting from this project will be made available through the national resource (iDigBio.org). Additional information about RSA, its outreach activities, and the results of this project is available at calbg.org.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Plants with unique morphologies &ndash; succulence, epiphytism, and carnivory/insectivory &ndash; that permit them to adapt to extreme habitats have fascinated botanists and plant enthusiasts for hundreds of years. Plants with unusual morphologies (cacti, orchids, agaves) are highly adapted to specific habitats (arid climates, forested habitats, and wet, low nutrient habitats) but face serious threats of changing climate regimes and potential risk of extinction.</p> <p>The Endless Forms Thematic Collections Network (TCN) aimed to build digital resources to document the vascular plants in 15 families that exhibit unique adaptations to extreme environments, and to promote scientific investigation and public understanding of these potentially imperiled plants. Through a recent Partnership with an Existing Network (PEN) award made by the National Science Foundation, the Herbarium at California Botanic Garden (RSA) enhanced the Endless Forms TCN by digitizing nearly 80,000 herbarium specimens representing all 15 families, some of which are especially diverse (cacti, agave, spurge) in California, a world biodiversity hotspot.</p> <p>Notable collections at RSA included: 1) the Cactus family (Cactaceae); 2) the Spurge family (Euphorbiaceae); and 3) the Agave family (Agavaceae). The data and images produced by this project enables researchers to investigate questions of morphological adaptation, patterns of diversification and endemism, and ecological niche evolution.</p> <p>Herbarium staff and students from Mt. San Antonio College and California Polytechnic University barcoded 78,231 specimens (112% of total goal), imaged 79,139 specimens (113% of total goal), databased 64,509 specimens (92% of total goal), and georeferenced 31,293 specimens (45% of total goal). Integral to the project were the activities that involve student and early career participation, which formed about 90% of the workforce. The project provided training for a total of two graduate students and six undergraduate and early career interns. Three herbarium curatorial assistants, all recent college graduates with degrees in biology and related fields, also participated in digitization efforts. All participants learned various aspects of herbarium collections management and digitization techniques, as well as opportunities to participate in six presentation-style workshops geared towards connecting students and early career professionals to collections, digitization, and the plant sciences.</p> <p>The California Botanic Garden Herbarium routinely provides tours to the public and notably to students from academic institutions in the Greater Los Angeles Metropolitan area. California Botanic Garden permits classes to waive their tour fee in exchange for volunteering a small amount of their time to barcode specimens, the first step in the digitization process. This approach provides students with a hands-on experience in a natural history collection setting and an opportunity for active learning rather than a passive tour. The pandemic limited this opportunity for students, but by September 2022 we were able to resume our full tour schedule to classes with the option of barcoding specimens to waive their tour fee. We hosted two barcoding events through coordinated efforts with faculty at Mt. San Antonio Community College and California Polytechnic University, Pomona. Collectively, undergraduate students enrolled in plant biology courses barcoded over 1,500 project specimens as partial fulfillment of their course objectives. Over the life of the grant we provided a total of 62 tours to 455 individuals; 23 tours represented classes from academic institutions in the Greater Los Angeles Metropolitan area and Inland Empire; 61% of those institutions represented Hispanic Serving Institutions.</p> <p>To inform the broader community of the Endless Forms project and significant results, dissemination included announcements on social media tracking our progress and the people involved; publication in the California Botanic Garden volunteer&rsquo;s newsletter, Oak Notes; and presentation at the Southern California Botanists 2020 symposium. An online exhibit highlighted project goals, aspects of the collections digitized, as well as the participants involved in the 3-year duration of the project. The online exhibit has been shared via social media outlets as well as our Collections Connection webpage (https://www.calbg.org/collections/collections-connection). We also developed &ldquo;Staff Picks&rdquo; wherein a noteworthy specimen in the Herbarium is highlighted from the viewpoint of herbarium staff members and shared via the Garden&rsquo;s social media platforms. The specimen many have been chosen for its aesthetics, history, or science behind the specimen, or an intriguing story. This was a way of giving voice to all of our staff and to highlight the unique collections of the Garden&rsquo;s Herbarium. Interns working on the Endless Forms project selected specimens to write about and share via social media.</p> <p>This project has largely mobilized RSA&rsquo;s collections of plants exhibiting unusual morphologies living in extreme environments. The data and images are being used by a broad community of researchers, students at various levels in their academic career, and the public. Through hands-on experiential learning, students involved in all aspects of the project have gained new skills applicable to a broad range of professions. Importantly, this opportunity has opened doors for the next generation to career possibilities in the plant sciences and natural history collections.</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 11/30/2023<br> Modified by: Mare&nbsp;Nazaire</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2001358/2001358_10700239_1701375843303_Fig_6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2001358/2001358_10700239_1701375843303_Fig_6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Online exhibit: staff picks"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2001358/2001358_10700239_1701375843303_Fig_6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Online exhibit: staff picks"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An online exhibit highlighting the project includes interns' selections for staff picks, selected specimens to showcase from the viewpoint of the staff or intern.
