<AbstractNarration>Representation theory is a branch of algebra studying symmetries, especially symmetries of linear mathematical structures, using groups of invertible matrices. On the other hand, algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving geometric problems about the sets of zeros of multivariable polynomials. The research supported by this NSF award is at the crossroads of representation theory and algebraic geometry, to use representation theory to solve geometric problems and to use geometric methods to understand representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research projects center on two main themes. In the first, the PI will develop a theory of conformal blocks for general parahoric group schemes over curves. The research will focus on Pappas-Rapoport conjecture, vanishing conjecture and Verlinde formula for twisted conformal blocks. This will lead to applications in orbifold conformal field theory and geometric Langlands program for parahoric group schemes. For the second theme, the PI will develop connections between the geometry of twisted affine Grassmannian and representation theory.  The geometry of affine Grassmannians can be related to Kac-Moody theory, representation theory of reductive groups and their bases via geometric Satake correspondence, and it also plays crucial role in symplectic duality. The research along this direction will advance the role of twisted affine Grassmannians in Kac-Moody theory, ramified geometric Satake, symplectic duality, and a connection with Springer theory for symmetric spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

In the joint project with Kumar, the PI developed the theory of twisted conformal blocks. They generalized the theory of Tsuchiya-Ueno-Yamada on conformal blocks to the equivariant setting, and they showed that twisted conformal blocks can be identified with generalized theta functions on the moduli of parahoric bundles under some mild conditions.They also derived the Verlinde formula for the space of twisted conformal blocks.Inspired by this project, in the joint work with Damiolini, the PI investigated the local types of equivariant bundles and established a relation with parahoric group schemes (including a global version).   Another main direction is twisted affine Grassmannian. In the joint work with Besson, the PI determined the smooth loci of spherical Schubert varieties in twisted affine Grassmannian, and we proved a duality between twisted Demazure modules and the coordinate ring of torus-fixed point subscheme of twisted Schubert varieties.In the joint work with Yu, the PI developed the theory of global Demazure modules and established arelation with Beilinson-Drinfeld Grassmannian of parahoric group schemes.In the work with Korkeathikum, the PI related the twisted Schubert varieties with nilpotent varieties in symmetric spaces.   With these efforts, one can understand the conformal blocks and the geometry of affine Grassmannians of parahoric group schemes much better.There is huge potential that these directions can be further developed much deeper. During the period of this grant, the PIdisseminated the results and works supported by this grant in many conferences and seminars. The PI successfully supervised 3 PhDs during this period, and all of their theses are related to this proposal.        Last Modified: 07/05/2024       Submitted by: JiuzuHong]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
