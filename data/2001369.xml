<AbstractNarration>Although the ancient Greeks saw arithmetic -- what we now call number theory -- and geometry as two distinct sciences, with very different methods, contemporary mathematicians have understood for many years that they are really two aspects of a single science.  This science, whose ramifications extend throughout mathematics, and whose applications are manifest in every corner of modern physics, computer science, and even the most recent developments in statistics, is as old as civilization, but it also takes on a completely new character at least once per generation.  The current project is a study of Langlands duality, a synthesis of number theory and the geometry of symmetry that has been one of the most familiar names for this science for nearly two generations.   For most of this period, the emblem of this synthesis has been the theory of L-functions, a computable system for encoding properties in number theory and geometry that matches the two aspects of this common science.  More recently, new and sophisticated geometric techniques promise to reframe the synthesis from above, as part of a larger synthesis that ultimately extends to the most speculative ideas in mathematical physics.  The PI plans to revisit Langlands duality from this new geometric standpoint, and to understand the place of L-functions in this broader picture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a contribution to the arithmetic theory of automorphic forms, in the setting of the Langlands program, motivated in part by the geometric Langlands program. The specific goals of the present project are the study of the local Langlands correspondence, using trace formula methods, L-functions, and Galois theory to reduce the local Langlands correspondence to a conjecture on "incorrigible" representations; the study of derived aspects of the Langlands program, inspired by both in specific cases arising from coherent cohomology and in the development of a unified geometric framework for both Langlands reciprocity for cohomology of locally symmetric spaces and Venkatesh's conjectures on the actions of derived deformation rings on cohomology; the construction of p-adic square root L-functions in families, using the higher Hida theory introduced by Pilloni and Boxer; the completion of the proof of an automorphic version of Deligne's conjecture on special values of tensor product L-functions; and the development of a character theory for mod p representations of p-adic groups.  In connection with this project, the PI is actively collaborating with colleagues in France, Austria, Germany, England, and Spain, as well as in the United States and Canada.  The methods involved in the present project combine techniques from arithmetic geometry and automorphic forms, especially the trace formula, categorical representation theory, and the new methods developed by Venkatesh, Darmon, and Gaitsgory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                   L-Functions and Geometric Methods in Langlands Duality: Project Outcomes Report       Although the ancient Greeks saw number theory and geometry  as two distinct sciences, with very different methods, contemporary mathematicians have understood for many years that they are really two aspects of a single science. This understanding has been substantially reinforced in recent years as what is meant by "geometry" has expanded practically beyond recognition. For Euclid a point was a dot on a papyrus or in the sand. In contemporary geometry, the "points" of a space are just the other spaces that have some relation to the original space, and to each other.    This kind of abstraction, which has developed to a degree barely imaginable even over the last 20 years, has proved extremely fruitful in its applications to number theory. Models designed by physicists to describe the collisions of particles have been adapted by Vincent Lafforgue, on the one hand, and by Dennis Gaitsgory, on the other hand, to solve geometric versions of longstanding problems originally raised by Langlands in his proposal for a unifying framework for number theory. Meanwhile, the kind of geometry developed by Peter Scholze and his collaborators has allowed prime numbers to be treated as variables, so that prime numbers like 5 or 7 can not only be cloned indefinitely but the clones can also "collide" with each other. This allowed Laurent Fargues and Scholze to introduce methods analogous to those of Lafforgue and Gaitsgory directly into number theory. Finally, this work is now rigorously possible thanks to the higher category theory and derived algebraic geometry developed by Jacob Lurie, which keeps track not only of relations between "points" of a generalized space, but also of relations between relations, and so on to infinity.    One of the aims of this project was to build on the PI's work with Venkatesh, and with Darmon, Rotger, and Venkatesh, which applied Lurie's insights to central questions in number theory. This direction continues with a joint paper with Feng and Mazur, and a second paper in preparation by the three of us and Raksit, that revisits the classic constructions of algebraic number theory in a "derived" setting. A second objective was to generalize Lafforgue's work to supercuspidal representations, objects that can be understood as multidimensional "particles." To my surprise, it turned out that the geometric methods I learned as a student can be combined with Lafforgue's results to obtain practically all the properties of these "particles" that are predicted by Langlands duality. A final aim was to explore the implications of Scholze's geometry for the theory of L-functions, which provide the basic framework for the Langlands program; this project is now well under way and continues.   Broader impacts of the project were developed through the PI's regular posts on the mechanization of mathematics in the Substack newsletter Silicon Reckoner, through the PI's public lectures on the same topic, through his participation in the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Fields Institute, and through his colloquium talks and lectures, including the Alaoglu lecture at Caltech and the Michalik lecture at the University of Pittsburgh.
