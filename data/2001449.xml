<AbstractNarration>This project aims to improve understanding of atmospheric chemistry that impacts ozone, particulate matter, and cloud chemical composition in the context of a rapidly changing Arctic. The atmosphere converts pollutants by processing them into water-soluble products that are removed through precipitation (rain or snow) or by deposition onto Earth’s surface. This chemical conversion of pollution happens through a sunlight-driven (photochemical) process known as oxidation. Most of what is known about these atmospheric processes comes from measurements made at the surface in Arctic coastal environments. The CHACHA team plans to use two instrumented aircraft to conduct airborne measurements around the Chukchi Sea, the Beaufort Sea, and the Alaska North Slope region. They plan to target features that are rapidly changing - above and downwind of sea ice "leads" (areas of open water in otherwise sea-ice-covered ocean regions), and downwind of sources of combustion-derived pollutants. Researchers will also use collected data to develop atmospheric models that will be openly available for use by the broader scientific community. The team is composed of researchers at six United States universities (in Alaska, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York) and will mentor a diverse group of students and postdoctoral scholars. Researchers will also engage in several additional education and outreach activities, including an “aircraft open house” and an annual three-day Science Fair in Utqiaġvik, AK. Overall, this project will enable the United States to better understand how rapid change in the Arctic impacts the chemical composition of the atmosphere and to translate what was learned to other regions - including the atmosphere above the world's oceans and in Earth's upper atmosphere. In addition, this project is co-funded by the Arctic Natural Sciences and Atmospheric Chemistry programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve understanding of atmospheric halogen chemistry in the gas, aerosol, and cloud water phases, with a focus on how that chemistry is impacted by Arctic sea ice loss and fossil fuel extraction. The CHACHA team plans to conduct eight weeks of observations during the Arctic spring, when halogen chemistry is most active, using two aircraft: the University of Wyoming King Air and the Purdue University Airborne Laboratory for Atmospheric Research (ALAR). Aircraft will conduct complementary sampling upwind and downwind of leads (sea ice fractures), over snow-covered tundra, and downwind of the North Slope of Alaska oilfields. Sampling will occur at various altitudes from the near-surface through the boundary layer and into the free troposphere. The team will prioritize measurement of various greenhouse gases (including O3, CO2, CH4, H2O), reactive trace gases (including NO2, SO2, N2O5, HO2NO2, bromine- and chlorine-containing gases), aerosol size distributions and composition, cloud residual particle composition, and cloud particle size distributions, as well as atmospheric data. These observations will be interpreted in part using 0-D and 1-D photochemical models and a cloud parcel model, to evaluate and advance understanding of multi-phase reactions and the vertical and horizontal propagation of atmospheric halogen chemistry in the Arctic. This dataset will improve understanding of the impact of the rapidly changing Arctic on halogen chemistry and atmospheric composition, as well as to provide fundamental knowledge of halogen chemistry that can be applied globally through models. The team will mentor students, postdocs, and conduct an array of unique outreach and educational activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This airborne atmospheric measurement campaign was carried out in early 2022 via two research aircraft, the University of Wyoming King Air and the Purdue University Airborne Laboratory for Atmospheric Research (ALAR), which flew out of Utqia&#289;vik, Alaska, which was temporarily called Barrow, Alaska. The project involved researchers from five institutions carrying out highly collaborative field measurements using state-of-the-art instrumentation. Research flights sampled gases and atmospheric particulate matter from the Brooks Range to over the sea ice to open cracks in the sea ice (leads) to the oil fields of Prudhoe Bay. The University of Alaska Fairbanks award was focused on measurement of the chemistry of reactive halogen gases, such as bromine monoxide, and their interactions with atmospheric particles, snow, and Arctic pollution such as the emissions of nitrogen oxides from Prudhoe Bay oil and gas facilities. These reactive halogen gases dominate springtime Arctic chemistry, affecting ozone, particulate matter, and potentially altering clouds, but the mechanism by which reactive halogen gases are formed and their chemistry is not well understood. These measurements were made with the Heidelberg Airborne Imaging DOAS Instrument (provided by collaboration with University of Heidelberg, Germany) on the ALAR aircraft. A total of 245 bromine monoxide vertical profiles were derived from "porpoising" maneuvers that the ALAR flight crew carried out. These profiles have unprecedented vertical resolution, with a unique measurement every 50 meters in the vertical, painting a high resolution picture of the influence of snowpack, lofted particles, and pollution on reactive halogen chemistry. A cluster analysis was used to categorize the 245 vertical profiles into four common profile shapes. This work improved our understanding of the influence of snowpack and lofted particulate matter on reactive bromine chemistry. We also observed interactions between Prudhoe Bay pollution and reactive bromine chemistry and mapped emissions from Prudhoe Bay in an effort to understand how industry in the Arctic affects the atmosphere. The measurements will be used to validate models of Arctic chemistry, which then can predict impacts of the rapidly changing Arctic on climate-relevant gases and particles. The work had broader impacts in furthering training of a postdoctoral associate, Nathaniel Brockway, who found permanent employment in the air quality measurement field.
