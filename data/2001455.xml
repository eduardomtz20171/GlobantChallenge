<AbstractNarration>The quality of information in the public sphere and its dissemination is of increasing concern. Furthermore, our understanding of the use of high-quality scientific information in state and local policymaking is lacking. This proposal addresses these gaps, focusing on the dissemination and use of research-based consensus reports by the public and their use state and local policymakers. Intermediary organizations often bridge the chasm between scholars and policymakers making scientific evidence useable and understandable. The work proposed in this project will develop understanding of how credible actors implement research findings in improving our society. The project will advance our understanding of knowledge intermediary organizations by examining how scientific and substantive intermediaries access, curate, and use the findings of science in their efforts to influence state and local policy-makers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the project is on the consensus reports of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM). Using a unique set of downloads provided from NASEM, the project examines how intermediary organizations access and make use of these reports, with a particular emphasis on the utilization of the reports by state and local policy organizations. The project will contribute to theory-building in science policy and science communication, by providing an understanding of how stacked intermediaries function in the scientific ecosystem. At a broader level, this work contributes to a better understanding of dissemination around scientific information. This project is jointly funded by the Science of Science program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
