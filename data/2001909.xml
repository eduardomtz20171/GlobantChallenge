<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2020 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Kimberly Ann Klinger Logan is "Intersections of Number Theory and String Theory: Differential equations in automorphic forms applied to zeros of L-functions and graviton scattering." The host institution for the fellowship is Rutgers University and the sponsoring scientist is Stephen D. Miller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This is done by studying Poisson type differential equations involving automorphic forms. Differential equations of this form appear both in problems involving zeros of L-functions as well as in computations of graviton scattering arising from string theory. These differential equations can be expressed using ODEs involving special functions that cannot be solved by traditional methods. In fact, solutions have yet to be found in all cases and even those we do know cannot be written down concisely.       In work with Miller and Radchenko, and separately with Fedosova, the PI found solutions to a family of differential equations (which generalize the one which appears in the graviton scattering amplitude) both directly and using Python. With these authors, we formally verified, and later generalized and proved, a conjecture coming from physics which gives an exact identity for a shifted convolution of divisor sums.

With Chandee and Li, this grant also supported work which relates the pair correlation of low-lying zeros of GL(2) L-functions to eigenvalues for random matrices.

Along this theme, with Thalgoda and Wong, we give special values of a new Dirichlet series.
