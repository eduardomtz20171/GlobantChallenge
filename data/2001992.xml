<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The goal of the PI's research is to understand how generally unruly objects in commutative algebra begin to behave when one takes into account a natural group action, the role combinatorial and diagrammatic techniques play in these results, and the ensuing implications in the fields of representation theory, combinatorics and algebraic geometry.   After completing his Ph.D., mainly focusing on diagram algebras and their role in representation stability, the PI used this fellowship to expand into an adjacent research area: properties of twisted commutative algebras and similar algebraic objects with (super) group actions. This fellowship allowed the PI to take on the following projects in this area:   1. Understanding equivariant prime ideals. Twisted commutative algebras are algebras with an action of the infinite general linear group. We can then define equivariant ideals and modules to be usual ideals and modules that are also closed under this inherited action of the general linear group. Given the growing interest in twisted commutative algebras and similar objects, it makes sense to try to understand their equivariant spectra. Snowden used super incarnations of these twisted commutative algebras to understand their equivariant spectra. The author worked with Snowden to extend these results to algebra objects with an action of other (super) groups. This resulted in a manuscript accepted in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society.   2. Equivariant Grbner Theory. Grbner methods have proven incredibly useful in understanding Noetherianity questions about combinatorial categories like FI, and FId. A twisted commutative algebra (TCA) is noetherian if any submodule of a finitely generated module is also finitely generated. A TCA is weakly noetherian if it is noetherian as a module over itself. Usually, the result about modules is implied by weak noetherianity, but in the equivariant setting this is no longer the case because all finitely generated modules are not just a quotient of a free module. Nagpal, Sam and Snowden, in the course of showing that a degree two twisted commutative algebra is noetherian, asked whether one could approach these results using Grbner methods. They proposed one approach and a resulting question that had been open since their paper in 2016. The PI found a counter-example to this approach and proposed a possible path forward. This resulted in a manuscript accepted in the Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society.   3. Equivariant Noetherianity for other Combinatorial Objects. A symmetric chain of ideals is a rule that assigns to each finite set S an ideal IS in a polynomial ring whose variables are indexed by elements of S such that any embedding of finite sets from S into T induces a homomorphism from IS into IT. Cohen proved a fundamental noetherian result for such chains, which has seen intense interest in recent years due to a wide array of new applications. In this paper, the PI worked with Snowden to consider similar chains of ideals, but where finite sets are replaced by more complicated combinatorial objects, such as trees. We give a general criterion for a Cohen-like theorem, and give several specific examples where our criterion holds. We also prove similar results for certain limiting situations, where a permutation group acts on an infinite variable polynomial ring. This connects to topics in model theory, such as Fraisse limits and oligomorphic groups. This resulted in a manuscript which has been submitted for publication.   All of these projects helped advance our understanding of a quickly growing field, equivariant commutative algebra, and find some new connections to other areas. This fellowship also enabled the PI to begin new collaborations.      Last Modified: 10/21/2024       Submitted by: RobertPLaudone]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
