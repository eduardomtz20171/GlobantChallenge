<AbstractNarration>This project aims to provide high-quality, long-term records of past streamflow in the Lower Missouri River (LMR) basin by integrating select gage records, modeled hydrology, and several complementary dendrochronology reconstruction approaches focusing on water-year and seasonal generation of runoff and the improved capture of extremes. This project seeks to: (1) incorporate gage data, estimates of natural flow, and modeled hydrology to develop streamflow calibration series; (2) generate reconstructions of streamflow for key sub-basin gages in the LMR, along with spatial reconstructions of runoff for the basin; (3) evaluate multi-century synoptic climate controls on LMR flow within a broader North American context; and (4) analyze the impact of warming temperatures on future flow patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extreme events (floods and droughts) have been common in the LMR over the past several decades, but the context for understanding the long-term hydroclimate variability impacting flow is limited due to a paucity of long streamflow records that are unaffected by human modification.  The LMR basin is one of the few remaining major river systems in the U.S. lacking streamflow reconstructions in large part due to the scarcity of reliable instrumental data for flow calibration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include an improved baseline understanding of droughts/floods/pluvials in the Lower Missouri River Basin and the involvement of stakeholders at all levels including water resource managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, The MRB provides critical aquatic habitat for a large range of fish and wildlife as well. Yet, the Missouri River is one of the more poorly understood river systems with respect to long-term variability and change. The instrumental and modeled streamflow records for the MRB only extend back as far as 1900. This is too short to provide the full range of variability of low flows and floods to be useful for understanding the kinds of variability that might occur in the future. To better understand and model the causes of Lower Missouri River Basin streamflow variability, which includes streamflow from the Upper Missouri River Basin as well, the National Science Foundation funded a collaborative, multi-institutional, research project titled &ldquo;Multi-Century Perspectives on Current and Future Flow in the Lower Missouri River Basin.&rdquo;</p> <p>A critical component of this research is the use of long tree-ring records to reconstruct past Lower Missouri River Basin streamflow back hundreds of years in the past. For this purpose, a network of long tree-ring chronologies in and around the full Missouri River Basin was created.

The final tree-ring network created by this project totaled 885 annual tree-ring chronologies, many of which were 600 or more years in length. This tree-ring network was then used to reconstruct total water year (October-September) river discharge at the Hermann, Missouri river gage (HEMO) not far from where the Missouri River empties into the Mississippi River. This reconstruction therefore estimates the discharge of the full Missouri River Basin, a result never before accomplished.
