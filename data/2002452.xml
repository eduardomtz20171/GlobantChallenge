<AbstractNarration>This project broadly seeks to reconstruct and interpret the state of the tropical Pacific over the last millennium in response to radiative forcing.  This will be accomplished by assimilating high-resolution paleo-proxies from corals and trees into a dynamical El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamically informed paleo-reconstructions will be studied to address the following science questions: (i) how does the tropical Pacific respond to external radiative forcing (ERF); (ii) does ENSO exhibit regime-like behavior and is ENSO irregularity primarily due to chaotic or to noise-driven dynamics; (iii) how has ENSO varied in the past; and (iv) can a dynamical ENSO model improve paleo-proxy reconstructions of the tropical Pacific. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These questions have implications for predictability and decadal variability and are relevant to understanding ENSO and its impacts, past, present and future. Adding information into paleoclimate reconstructions from a dynamical model of ENSO with documented predictive skill is a novel approach and may enhance interpretation of Tropical Pacific proxy records. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts include improved understanding of ENSO behavior over time, support of undergraduate students in the research project, and outreach to the public through well-established outreach efforts at Columbia University and the University of Maryland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most powerful interannual climate variability mode, with global climate and economic impacts. Incidentally, it is the only one whose predictions with lead times of about a year have demonstrable skill. These properties make ENSO variability important as a major object of climate research and an ever-present phenomenon societies must negotiate. Thus, improving ENSO predictions and our knowledge of past ENSO variability is necessary.

Each of the attempted reconstructions going from 1100, 1200, ..., 1800 CE to 2000 CE (called R11, R12,..., and R18, respectively) only used the chronologies that spanned the entire reconstruction interval (see Figure 3B for R15 predictors' pool). A reconstruction extending back to 1500 (R15), based on 242 tree-ring chronologies, showed exceptional skill; the one expanding back to 1100 (R11) used 81 chronologies and was the longest one with acceptable skill, accounting for 50% of the validation period variance [3].

Figures 5AB show equatorial Pacific DJF SST variability from&nbsp; RSOI and RSOS assimilations of marine records. Data assimilation products present non-zero anomalies whenever any observations are available.
