<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program along with the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Chemistry Division supports Professor Jeffrey T. Petty at Furman University to control and fine-tune the colors and emissions of nanoscale metal chromophores (color-producing molecules) using DNA strands as scaffolds. This research impacts the burgeoning area of metal-linked DNA constructs that expand the genetic code of DNA for optical sensing and imaging applications.  Metals are widely used in society due to their high conductivity, malleability, and reflectivity.  As metal particles shrink to nanometer dimensions of 1000 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair, their electrons reorganize and new properties emerge.  For example, although bulk silver is highly reflective, clusters of a few-atoms of silver have diverse colors that depend on the cluster size, shape, and charge. Through the combined expertise of Professor Petty at Furman University along with Professors Raquel Lieberman and Robert Dickson at the Georgia Institute of Technology, atomic-resolution structures of nanoscale DNA-silver clusters are measured with X-ray diffraction.  The electronic organization of the nanoscale structures are probed over nano- to milli-second time scales with laser-precision.  The educational broader impact of the project centers on the mentoring and training of undergraduate students at Furman University, a primarily undergraduate institution, through a comprehensive research experience.  Furman undergraduate students spearhead their individual research projects through close collaboration with graduate students and faculty from major research universities such as the Georgia Institute of Technology and the University of Münster.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program and the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Professor Petty’s team at Furman University develops DNA-silver cluster chromophores using a structure-guided approach.  Silver clusters with ~10 atoms are stabilized by DNA strands, and the spectra and photophysics of these adducts are encoded via the DNA nucleobases.  To date, DNA-silver cluster chromophores have been empirically developed for specific sensing and imaging applications.  A recent atomic-level structure of a DNA-silver cluster complex identifies three structural motifs that show how the silvers and DNA are organized. A DNA dimer with two A2C4 strands traps eight silver atoms that are arranged as in the Big Dipper asterism. A subset of five silver atoms mimics the dipper because they have a trapezoid shape. These are separated by metallic bond distances and are likely the chromophoric core of the green-emitting complex. The three other silver atoms resemble the dipper handle because they disperse between pairs of cytosines and join the DNA strands. These three bonding motifs are selectively modified by borrowing tools from chemistry and biochemistry. The modification tools are for chemically modifying nucleobase heteroatoms, enzymatically excising nucleobases, and synthetically linking DNA strands. The electronic environment of the resulting clusters is comprehensively characterized via steady-state, time-resolved, and chirooptical spectroscopies.  DNA-cluster conjugates with distinctive spectra are characterized by mass spectrometry to determine the numbers and distributions of silver atoms within the complex. These species are then screened using a wide range of solution conditions to form crystals and analyzed by X-ray diffraction to establish the relationship between the DNA-silver bonding and silver cluster spectra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Their instability is curbed when they are shielded and wrapped by DNA strands. The resulting nanoscale conjugates survive in harsh aqueous and biological environments, and our studies addressed the structure, spectra, and reactivity of these DNA-caged clusters. These studies bridge nanoscience and biochemistry and provided a gateway to train a wide range of undergraduate students.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>  <p><strong>Structure:</strong>&nbsp; When strands of DNA encapsulate silver clusters, supramolecular optical chromophores develop. However, how a particular structure endows a specific spectrum remains poorly understood. We used neutron diffraction to map protonation in (A<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-Ag<sub>8</sub>, a green-emitting fluorophore with a &ldquo;Big Dipper&rdquo; arrangement of silvers. Through our partnership with the neutron diffraction facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, we learned that this DNA host has two substructures with distinct protonation patterns. Three cytosines from each strand collectively chelate handle-like array of three silvers. The twisted cytosines are further joined by hydrogen bonds from fully protonated amines. The adenines and their neighboring cytosine from each strand anchor a dipper-like group of five silvers via their deprotonated endo- and exocyclic nitrogens. Acidification and deprotonation suggest that silvers perturb the electron distribution in the aromatic nucleobases. The different protonation states in (A<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-Ag<sub>8</sub> suggest that atomic level structures can pinpoint how to control and tune the electronic spectra of these nanoscale chromophores.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Reactivity:</strong>&nbsp; Our structural studies inspired the study artificial DNA hosts for silver clusters. We studied two chromophores that share the same DNA host:&nbsp; C<sub>4</sub>-A<sub>2</sub>-iCT mimics structural elements in a DNA-cluster crystal structure using a phosphodiester backbone with combined 5&prime; &rarr; 3&prime; and 3&prime; &rarr; 5&prime; (indicated by &ldquo;i&rdquo;) directions. This template creates two chromophores Ag<sub>11</sub><sup>7+</sup> and Ag<sub>14</sub><sup>8+</sup>, which can be reversibly oxidized and reduced without disrupting the underlying Ag<sup>+</sup>&ndash;DNA matrix. These studies suggest that Ag<sup>+</sup> disperses with the cytosines to create an adenine binding pocket for the Ag<sup>0</sup> cluster chromophores.</p>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DNA-bound silver clusters also catalyze chemical reactions. A DNA-tethered alkyne conjugates with an azide via cycloaddition, an inherently slow reaction that is facilitated through the joint efforts of the cluster and DNA. The Ag<sub>10</sub><sup>6+</sup> structure is the catalytic core in this complex, but the C<sub>4</sub>AC<sub>4</sub>TC<sub>3</sub>GT<sub>4</sub> host guides catalytic activity in two ways. The DNA has orthogonal functional groups for both the alkyne and cluster, and these can be systematically separated to quench the click reaction. It is also a polydentate ligand that imprints an elongated shape on its cluster adduct. This extended structure suggests that DNA may pry apart the cluster to open coordination sites for the alkyne and azide reactants. These studies indicate that this DNA/silver cluster pair work together with catalysis directly driven by the silver cluster and indirectly guided by the DNA host.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Spectroscopy:</strong>&nbsp; Molecular silver clusters emit across the visible to near-infrared, and C<sub>4</sub>AC<sub>4</sub>TC<sub>3</sub>G selectively coordinates and encapsulates Ag<sub>10</sub><sup>6+</sup>, a chromophore with two distinct electronic transitions. The green emission is strong and prompt with &#981; = 18% and &tau; = 1.25 ns, and the near-infrared luminescence is weaker, slower with &tau; = 50 &micro;s, and is partly quenched by oxygen, suggesting phosphorescence. This lifetime can be modulated by the DNA host, and we considered derivatives of C<sub>4</sub>AC<sub>4</sub>TC<sub>3</sub>G with similar sequences but distinct structures. In particular, the covalent phosphate linkage was broken into two fragments. In relation to the contiguous strand, the broken template speeds the luminescence decay by twofold, and this difference may be due to greater DNA flexibility. These modifications suggest that a DNA can be structurally tuned to modulate metastable electronic states in its silver cluster adducts.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>  <p>The proposed studies comprehensively educated young scientists through interdisciplinary chemistry research coupled with community outreach.
