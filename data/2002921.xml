<AbstractNarration>An accurate map showing usage of the wireless spectrum can be used to inform spectrum policy, determine usage patterns and situational awareness, and evaluate the feasibility of opportunistic spectrum access methods indoors and outdoors, especially in the crowded sub-6 GHz spectrum.  However, the success of creating such a map depends on the quality and quantity of sensors measuring spectrum activity, and how their measurements are processed by a centralized server.  In general, because the sensors operate in an unknown or time-varying environment, many distributed sensors are generally needed to compensate for this uncertainty.  As a result, the cost, power consumption, and size of the sensors need to be very low to allow wide-scale deployment.  This project examines the sensor quality versus quantity tradeoff for a large-scale distributed measurement system that infers wireless activity throughout a region. Knowledge of the activity of the spectrum is hampered by the lack of accurate real-time measurements on a truly large scale and deploying a large number of sensors is hampered by cost, power, and complexity.  The research addresses the important aspect of how to commoditize the hardware and drive the cost and power down by an order of magnitude, thus potentially paving the way to large spectrum data sets.  The work will be used to seed projects at an existing Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Notre Dame.  The results will be disseminated to the research community to encourage discussions about how spectral occupancy can be measured reliably in a low-cost and scalable manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A spectrum sensor is, at its heart, a power detector for frequency bands of interest. Traditionally, such a sensor is evaluated as a radio since it generally tunes and down-converts its input to an intermediate-frequency or baseband signal, digitizes, filters, and then analyzes the power spectrum.  The standard performance specifications of a radio include sensitivity, linearity, bandwidth, image-rejection, frequency stability, phase noise, and dynamic range.  Meeting stringent requirements on these specifications contributes directly to cost and power consumption.  However, spectrum mapping system performance is also determined by the ability of the centralized server to infer activities over a whole region from a widely distributed set of sensors. This research focuses on relaxing many sensor requirements, and analyzing how a real-time spectrum mapping system that uses machine-learning performs when the number of sensors is increased to compensate for the reduced capability per sensor.  The effort seeks to show that there is an advantageous trade-off of quantity over quality---the information learned from additional sensors in a large-scale deployment easily compensates for their reduced individual capabilities, especially when accounting for cost and power consumption. Implications for computational and network load requirements and sensor size are also considered. This research effort is an innovative whole-system approach to determining the quality-quantity contour for distributed spectrum measurements.  The effort will: (i) establish models, metrics, and fidelity criteria for the performance of a machine-learning radio-frequency spectrum sensing system with distributed sensors; (ii) examine opportunities to dramatically reduce sensor cost and power consumption; (iii) build an extensive test and measurement platform of sensors to validate the assumptions, analyses, methods and conclusions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project analyzes of the tradeoff of sensor quality and quantity when creating a spectrum power map. The sensors measure power in a frequency band of interest, but the system estimates the use (occupancy) of spectrum even in areas where there are no sensors.    An accurate power map that is updated at a rapid (millisecond) rate can be used to inform spectrum policy, determine usage patterns and situational awareness, and evaluate the feasibility of opportunistic spectrum access. This project showed that such mapping is possible over broad regions (tens of square kilometers), or smaller regions (one square kilometer) with only a few dozen sensors placed randomly and uniformly throughout the region. It was also shown that a neural-network can be trained to infer fine (square-meter) resolution occupancy with suitable forward-model training tools. Even sensors with very high noise or coarse resolution were shown to be effective at inferring occupancy throughout the region. Hence, this project paves a road for how crowd-sourced spectrum measurements can be used to create an accurate map even in regions where there are no sensors.    The included figure shows how only ten sensors can be used in a 1 square-kilometer region in downtown Chicago to infer spectrum occupancy (at 2100 MHz) with (2x2)square-meter resolution. Shown are the true occupancy (in blue) and the estimated occupancy with threshold  = -95 dBm (yellow shows estimated occupancy where purple shows no occupancy).    The project also designed a specialized low-power integrated mixer for sub-6 GHz sensing, with the goal of creating a power sensor that covered the most popular bands in use today for cellular and WiFi with low cost and power. This mixer would then be used to lower the power consumption of an existing three Watt radio by at least one Watt. The mixer has been taped out in 65 nm, includes 4 ring oscillators, each of which has a dedicated mixing channel. The total power, including mixer and output amplifier consumes 7 mW per channel for 200 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth per channel.
