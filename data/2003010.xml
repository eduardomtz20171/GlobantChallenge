<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Joshua Kritzer of Tufts University to develop new chemical building blocks that control the shape of peptides to mimic distinct conformations seen in proteins. Peptides are short polymer chains of amino acids that share many properties with larger proteins. The ability to control the three-dimensional shape or conformation of peptides allows the control of these properties and, consequently, their functions.  In this project, chemical tethers are used to link an unnatural amino acid (one that is not found in terrestrial organisms) to another amino acid along the chain to constrain the shape of the peptide.  The resulting peptides have potential applications in materials science, as catalysts and in drug development. In addition, the project prepares students to enter the science workforce through the development of a series of training workshops that help students practice professional skills, provide career guidance, and promote diversity and inclusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project employs a new strategy for side-chain-mediated cross-linking, or “stapling,” that takes advantage of the unique conformational properties of the unnatural amino acid 4-mercaptoproline.  Multiple independent strategies are used to incorporate 4-mercaptoproline staples into peptides, producing unique varieties of stapled beta-hairpins, stapled collagen-like helices and assemblies, and stapled bicyclic peptides.  The three-dimensional structures of these designed structural scaffolds are determined by solution-state NMR spectroscopy. The effects of the new staples on biological degradation and cell penetration are examined through cell-based assays. The long term broader scientific impact of this work is to provide tools and methodology to control peptide architecture and biological stability and in so doing construct polypeptides with particular utility for studies in chemical biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Peptides are important sources for new drugs, biotechnology platforms, and materials, and controlling their three-dimensional shape is a large part of controlling their activity and usefulness. In this project, we explored a new method for locking peptides into specific, useful shapes. The main Intellectual Merit of this project was 1) the novel chemical method that we developed to lock peptides into specific shapes, and 2) the two applications we demonstrated for the method. The project used novel, constrained building blocks and a chemical reaction which we call stapling to lock those building blocks together. This approach worked well, and we reported two different examples where this method produced robust stapled peptides in different shapes.    In the beginning of the project, we had to optimize the stapling reaction and demonstrate that it worked well. Our optimized process allowed us to staple the new building blocks with nearly 100% efficiency. Then, collaborating with leading computational scientists, we used computational tools to design well-structured peptides with the new building blocks and stapling chemistry. Specifically, we produced a beta-hairpin peptide which was locked into its hairpin structure by the new staple. The hairpin peptide was extremely stable to heat and to biological degradation, and careful controls showed that these extraordinary properties were directly due to the new chemistry.    In another example, we used the new stapling chemistry to improve upon peptides that bind the human proteins LC3B and GABARAP. These proteins are involved in autophagy, a cellular recycling process, and inhibitors are useful tools to better understand autophagy. Compared to our original strategy, the new building blocks and stapling chemistry produced more potent inhibitors of these autophagy proteins, also with increased stability to biological degradation. Eventually, we expect that these inhibitors will inform other projects that are actively pursing drugs by targeting these same proteins.    The Broader Impacts of this project included supporting the scientific and professional development of multiple graduate students, and supporting the production and implementation of professional development workshops for graduate students in the Tufts University Department of Chemistry.
