<AbstractNarration>Topology is a field of mathematics that studies those properties of a space that remain invariant under stretching or bending. A surface of a fixed topological shape can have many different geometries. For example, a two-dimensional shape with no holes is a topological sphere, which could be a round sphere (like the surface of a planet), a polyhedron (a crystal like-shape with facets), or an ellipsoid (an egg-type shape). A shape with one hole (a torus) could look like an inner tube, a tire, or a hula hoop. The collection of all possible geometries is known as a moduli space, and these spaces occur over and over again in fundamental physical questions. This NSF award provides funding for a project to study questions of what typical, or random, surfaces look like, from the point of view of understanding families of curves on these surfaces. The research and outreach activities are mutually reinforcing; the project highlights bridges between different areas of mathematics, and deep connections between research, mentoring, and public engagement programs in mathematics. In addition the project provide research training opportunities for graduate students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Starting with simple to state problems about counting special trajectories on surfaces whose geometry comes from Euclidean polygons and polyhedra, and motivated by theoretical physics (Newtonian mechanics, electron transport, and supersymmetric quantum field theory), this project connects to fundamental questions in many different areas of mathematics, including Teichmuller and homogeneous dynamics; Diophantine approximation and the geometry of numbers; probabilistic models and limit theorems; and the geometry of moduli spaces of meromorphic differentials on surfaces. Building on his prior collaborative work, the PI plans to explore questions on the counting and distributions of curves in varying geometries on higher-genus surfaces and higher-dimensional tori.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project explored counting problems and statistics associated to curves on surfaces, motivated by problems in geometry and dynamical systems. In particular, many of the problems were motivated by simple Newtonian mechanical problems (billiards in polygons) which lead to surprisingly complex mathematics, touching on many different subfields, including geometry, algebraic geometry, dynamical systems, number theory, and others.   My work centers a probabilistic perspective and uses ideas of renormalization to study problems of counting and correlations for curves and special trajectories on surfaces arising from special billiard trajectories, for example. In the attached images, one sees figures from two papers which were written with the support of the grant, one studying trajectories of triply periodic polyhedral surfaces (which arise in the study of electricity and magnetism) and the other associated to studying the movement of particles on the dodecahedron.   In addition to several peer-reviewed papers, this project resulted in a new book (joint with Howard Masur) on Translation Surfaces (which will make the field accessible to a new generation of students), and the research informed several art projects and public-facing works (online videos, exhibits, documentaries, and general interest articles).   The project also enabled the mentorship of several students and postdocs, as well as many undergraduates who worked on experimental and exploratory projects in the mathematical sciences.   Finally, the results of the project have opened up several new vistas in research on the geometry and statistics of curves on surfaces, which we are actively pursuing.
