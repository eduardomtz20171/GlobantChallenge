<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. John-Stephen Taylor at Washington University-Saint Louis to develop methods for establishing the existence and locations of G-quadruplexes in cells. The double-helical B-DNA structure discovered by Watson and Crick revolutionized the understanding of how genetic information is replicated and expressed as RNA and proteins in cells.  G-quadruplexes are labile four-stranded DNA structures that have more recently been found, along with other non-B-DNA structures, to add new dimensions to the fundamental understanding of how the expression of genetic information is controlled.  The study uses a unique reaction of G-quadruplexes with light that leads to indelible and unique molecular imprints in DNA.  These distinctive imprints provide direct evidence for the existence of G-quadruplexes in cells, allowing their positions and dynamic behavior to be investigated within the human genome. The existence of G-quadruplexes and other non-B DNA structures lead to better understanding of their roles in disease development. Graduate students working on this project receive multidisciplinary training in synthetic organic chemistry, photochemistry, automated DNA synthesis, molecular and cellular biology, and mass spectrometry.  In addition, teaching modules and tutorials for high school students are developed that use physical and computer models to understand G-quadruplex structures and how their photochemistry differs from that of standard B-DNA.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on a long-standing program in the principal investigator's laboratory to use chemical and biophysical tools to study the details of complex nucleic acis structures, with a particular focus on G-quadruplex structures.  The scientific approach takes advantage of the observation that UV irradiation of G-quadruplex-forming sequences containing thymine (T) and cytosine (C) bases in adjacent lateral loops results in the formation of stable anti-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (anti-CPDs), photoproducts that cannot form in canonical B-DNA.  Highly sensitive methods are developed to detect these anti-CPDs photoproducts in cells using post-labeling and isotope dilution mass spectrometric methods. Their positions within the genome are located through ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods.  Structure-photoreactivity relationships that serve as unique molecular signatures of G-quadruplexes and other related non-B DNA conformations are determined using enzyme-coupled mass spectrometry assays of site-specific isotopically labeled DNA.  The broader impacts include presenting research opportunities to students from traditionally underrepresented communities and the development of new materials to teach concepts of DNA structure that align with educational standards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The goal of this project was to develop new methodology for identifying and locating the presence of unusually folded structures of DNA, the genetic material of life, inside living cells. These unusually folded DNA structures are of great interest because they are hypothesized to play important roles in the controlling the functions of cells. It has been very difficult to establish the existence and location of these structures in living cells, however, because of their transient nature. We had hypothesized that we could trap these fleeting structures by using a pulse of ultraviolet (UV) light to irreversibly cross-link remote (non-adjacent) parts of their folded structures together, thereby allowing them to be identified and located in a spatial and temporal manner. To this end we developed a highly sensitive method for identifying the existence of such cross-linked structures by degrading the DNA with enzymes to a small non-adjacent cross-linked molecules that could be labeled with radioactive material so that they could be detected at very low levels. Attempts to detect the formation of these non-adjacent cross-linked molecules following irradiation of human cells have so far not succeeded, possibly due to their much lower abundance than expected. We therefore also developed an alternative method for detecting the same non-adjacent cross-linked molecules using mass spectrometry instead of radioactivity and have validated it for model systems but have not yet in cells. Lastly, we investigated the use of a sequencing technology based on measuring the current changes when a single DNA molecule passes through a small pore (nanopore sequencing) to determine the location of non-adjacent crosslinked DNA. We expected that the non-adjacent cross-linked DNA would be prevented from passing through the nanopore whereas adjacent cross-linked DNA arising from normal DNA would not be but would substantially alter the current. At this point we have been able to detect single adjacent cross-links formed in normal DNA, as well as tandem adjacent cross-links that cannot be assayed by existing methods. More work will be needed to determine if unusually folded DNA structures can be identified by nanopore technology.    The two analytical techniques that we developed for the identification of non-adjacent crosslinked DNA photoproducts will enable researchers to probe for the involvement of certain types of non-B form DNA structures in model systems and in living cells. The ability to sequence adjacent cross-linked photoproducts in single DNA molecules using nanopore technology will facilitate studies of the formation and repair of adjacent crosslinked DNA induced by sunlight that can lead to skin cancer. Another potential application of our methodology is for probing the structure of the RNA which is produced from DNA by determining the formation and location of adjacent and non-adjacent RNA crosslinks by nanopore sequencing. The methods we developed for assaying UV-crosslinked DNA should also be applicable to the study of the folding and interactions in DNA-based materials.    As part of this grant, we also developed tutorials for high school and university students that are freely available on the web to help better understand the structure of normal and folded DNA through the construction of accurate 2D and 3D models of DNA from card stock and by computer modeling. The 3D models employed magnets to mimic the H-bonding interactions that hold DNA together thereby allowing students to explore various possible ways in which DNA can assemble and fold. The tutorials also illustrate how UV light can be used to crosslink the folded DNA structures and thereby provide information about the structure of the DNA from which they arose. We also created interactive 3D computer modeling-based tutorials of various normal and folded DNA structures with instructions on how to create one's own 3D modeling tutorials. These approaches to understanding DNA structure were also disseminated to local high school teachers through a hands-on workshop and have been used in courses taught by the PI at the undergraduate and graduate level.    This NSF grant has resulted in three peer reviewed publications, with two additional manuscripts in preparation. A website was also created that contains all the tutorials and instructional material for the preparation of 2D and 3D models, as well as interactive computer-generated 3D molecular modeling tutorials. This grant also supported the training of three PhD students (one of which is from an under-represented minority) and one undergraduate. Two of the PhD students received joint training between the PI and a biological mass spectrometrist. All three PhD students presented their work multiple times at international and local meetings which enabled them to network with researchers from academics, government, and industry thereby strengthening their interest and commitment to pursuing careers in science. Two PhD students are continuing their PhD studies, the other is pursing postdoctoral studies in photobiology, and the undergraduate is planning to attend graduate school in chemistry.
