<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates the spin of electrons in a special type of materials (artificially layered oxides) where the direction of the antiferromagnetic spins can be controlled. The knowledge gained from this project could help develop novel electronic devices for information processing which, unlike traditional electronic devices, are not limited by heat generated by electron flow. These new devices would have faster operation, scalability to nanoscale regimes, and robust stability due to the insensitivity to external applied electric or magnetic fields. The research project develops new measurement techniques and devices, and trains young scientists and engineers in a field that combines Physics, Materials Science and Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. Outreach activities include supporting the University of Denver Society for Physics Students, their outreach programs at local museums and amusement parks, and the UC Davis Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of spin transport in a nearly ideal antiferromagnetic model system consisting of antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic interfaces in perovskite oxide heterostructures. This system provides the unique ability to control the antiferromagnetic order with low values of applied magnetic field through spin-flop coupling (perpendicular alignment) with an adjacent ferromagnetic layer. In addition, as temperature increases, the antiferromagnetic order evolves to show parallel alignment with the ferromagnetic layer in nanowire structures. The focus is to measure non-local spin transport which provides an unambiguous probe of spin flow.  Additional education activities include the training of undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art synthesis, nano-lithography, and characterization tools, including synchrotron radiation-based characterization techniques at U.S. national laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project focused on understanding spin and charge flow in epitaxial perovskite oxide film systems that coupled an antiferromagnetic layer with a ferromagnetic layer. The intent was to combine the ease of control of the ferromagnet (which can be manipulated with external magnetic field, among other means) with the expected advantages of antiferromagnetic systems, including large velocity of spin excitations. The project, which was collaborative with the group of Prof. Yayoi Takamura at UC Davis, encompassed nanofabrication of test structures on the samples grown by Prof. Takamuras group, and electrical and magnetic testing of these structures and samples. We also studied related samples with the techniques we developed or implemented in the course of this work. These included other antiferromagnets, including significant work to further understanding of the role of antiferromagnetism in converting spin and charge in chromium.   We also focused on understanding and characterizing the magnetic order in the coupled AFM/FM systems, which helped lay the groundwork for future studies that could use these materials for information applications.   We communicated these and other Intellectual Merit results in six papers in refereed archival journals (three already published, one in the review process and two others in preparation), presenting 4 invited talks at conferences and University seminars, and via more than 5 contributed talks presented by PhD students.     The Broader Impacts of this project included education and technical training and public outreach. This included full or partial support and mentorship of three PhD students, including one that completed his PhD during the project period. The two others completed their PhD successfully in the months after the project ended. One these students moved on to a technical jobs in high-tech industry, where they use their scientific skills daily. The two others both took positions as post-doctoral scholars in academic research groups, where they use the skills gained in the course of this project on a daily basis. Public outreach included service to the scientific community (most notable with the PI's service as the General Chair for the 2023 Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials), and work with and support of the DU Society of Physics chapter.
