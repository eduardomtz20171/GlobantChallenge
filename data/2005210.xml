<AbstractNarration>Quantum dots are very small particles whose properties can be changed by changing the size, shape, or composition of the dot.  This research is about understanding the interactions between these quantum dots that have been arranged into ordered solids Once the quantum dots are organized into ordered solids, called a super-lattice, then the solids exhibit new optical and electronic properties that arise from the interaction between the quantum dots. The properties of the quantum dot super-lattices are controllable by changing the coupling between the quantum dots. The electronic coupling is changed by controlling the distance between particles, by connecting the quantum dots with bridges, or by filling in the spaces between the dots with another material. This research seeks to fabricate more ordered quantum dot super-lattices to explore materials properties with utilization in devices like solar cells, photodetectors, and thermoelectrics. However, it is hard to investigate structures that one cannot see. To overcome this roadblock, the use of high-resolution scanning transmission electron tomography with near-atomic direct-space imaging will be developed. This new high-resolution tomographic data will provide sufficient detail to provide feedback between sample fabrication and resulting superlattice order to enable the fabrication of more perfect samples with larger super-lattice domains, more evenly distributed bridges, and fewer defects. The new high-resolution data will also enable new theoretical approaches to model the interaction between quantum dots in the solid so that increases in super-lattice order can be tied to specific changes in the optical and electronic properties. The long-term goal is to develop solids from quantum dots that are perfect enough to increase the charge mobility by about ten times. This research will be shared with the public by publishing the scanning transmission electron tomography data on a publicly downloadable forum and creating non-technical educational videos about the materials to be published on the internet. Outreach and education to underserved communities will provide hands-on STEM training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colloidal quantum-dots (QDs), organized in a super-lattice, have demonstrated collective electronic and excitonic behavior across mesoscale dimensions. The specifics of how small degrees of spatial disorder, surface chemical defects, and epitaxial defects affect this collective behavior or how to fabricate more perfect super-lattice structures are not understood. This project will use tomographic imaging with a resolution of 4-5 Å over 1000s of QDs to measure these small degrees of structural disorder in real space. This research has a strong emphasis on improving the imaging technique to enable higher resolution and to improve the reconstruction technique to increase the image volume. These improvements to the image quality will enable near atomic mapping of all QDs, necks, and defects, driving improvement in fabrication, structural control, and understanding of electronic structure/property relationships. The feedback of near atomic resolution imaging will enable improved fabrication with the goals of 100% neck connectivity and uniformity with super-lattice grain sizes of at least 10 µm and charge mobility approaching 50 cm2 V-1 s-1. The improved sample quality and high-resolution 3D real-space imaging will facilitate theoretical approaches that can study hopping vs. charge transport through delocalized “mini-bands” and will be validated by variable-temperature Hall-effect measurements. The proposed tomography pushes the limits of resolution/volume achieving reconstructions of large mesoscale samples with high spatial resolution. The expected outcome is multiple ultra-high-resolution tomograms that inform the structure formation mechanism, improved fabrication, mass transport to form QD-QD necks, and spatial resolution to inform realistic electronic modeling based on data. The research goals are multi-pronged with focus on fabrication design rules that can be applied to other QD super-lattices, improved scanning transmission electron tomography techniques to enhance tomogram spatial resolution and data interpretation, and mesoscale modeling of delocalized transport using real spatial data. By combining these approaches this project connects between nanoscale structure, mesoscale order, and bulk materials properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Broad Background: </strong>Quantum dots (QDs) are nanocrystals that display optoelectronic properties that are size dependent. PbSe QDs display multiple exciton generation, a process in which a single light photon results in two photoelectrons. Ordered layers of PbSe QDs could be used to improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices, but no one has invented a way to make the particles order over large areas. Co-PI Law developed a method to crystalize QDs into a super crystal of crystals called a quantum dot super lattice. The original super lattice samples still had a lot of defects but provided a pathway to study QDSLs. Studying a 3D QDSL presents extreme measurement difficulties. The QDs have a diameter of about 5.5 nm, which means they can only be imaged using electron microscopies. To measure the 3D arrangement of the QDs, a tomographic image uses a series of 2D images taken from different angles to digitally reconstruct a 3D volume. Moule specializes in tomographic imaging to study the organization of the QDs and necking between nearest neighbor particles to determine how the fabrication conditions affect the QDSL order over length scales from 1s to 100s of nm.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>One Sentence Goal:</strong> The research funded in NSF award 2005210 was focused on improving the structural and orientational order of QDSL samples and developing ET as a measurement modality capable of capturing the hierarchical order in the samples.</p> <p><strong>Research Progress: </strong>Zimanyi&rsquo;s group modeled the effect variation in QD diameter, neck thickness between neighboring QDs, or a missing neck between QDs.<sup>1</sup> Then then worked with the Law group to study SEM images of many many QDSL surfaces to study how the morphology could affect the charge mobility.<sup>2</sup> The single most important structural factor that would improve the charge mobility of a QDSL was to achieve &gt;99% of particles with 6 nearest neighbor necks as the presence of a missing neck led to local minima in the potential energy surface for charges.<sup>3</sup> This study showed that they could achieve a single grain mobility of up to 6.5 cm<sup>2</sup>/V S for samples fabricated using the injection method for ligand exchange, which achieved 65-75% neck formation.</p> <p><strong>Fabrication Progress</strong>: In 2022, Law published a breakthrough study introducing a photobase reaction (Fig 2b-c). The ligand is slowly removed by a base that is generated by UV irradiation. The Law group could use a low power UV lamp to slowly replace ligands from 1-6 hours, instead of 1-2 s using the injection method.<sup>4</sup> The increased control over the ligand exchange reaction rate from the photobase method resulted in much larger domains, less large-scale cracking of the film, near universal neck formation, and greater removal of oleate ligand.<sup>4</sup> &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Measurement Progress</strong>: The Moule group studied QDSL with inprecidented resolution using electron tomography.<sup>5</sup> Fig 3 shows the sample preparation and Fig. 3d depicts 633 QDs in 9 layers with resolution high enough to map the position of many Pb atoms in real space.

For each of the 633 QDs we determined its center of mass location (x,y,z), necking thickness with neighbors, atomic lattice orientation of each QD, and relative position of each particle compared to the layer average. All total we were able to measure 9 tomograms spanning from 6 layers thickness to 40 layers and from 250 QDs to ~8300 QDs over the course of this award.
