<AbstractNarration>These projects aim to address major problems in the field of algebraic topology.  Topology is the study of geometry where you identify one geometric object with another if one can be deformed into the other. The goal of algebraic topology is to ascribe discrete algebraic invariants to these geometric objects to distinguish their topological types.  In this way, distinguishing geometric objects is reduced to algebraic computations.  Understanding the topological type of geometric objects is a fundamental act of scientific/mathematical inquiry, comparable to the study of prime numbers, or the classification of the fundamental particles that constitute matter and carry forces.  Topological computations have recently been applied to solve problems in solid state physics.  Also, data involving the interrelation of a large number of variables naturally traces out a geometric object in a high dimensional space.  The study of such data-sets using algebraic topology is the subject of the new and active field of topological data analysis.  The focus of these projects is in the interaction of classical algebraic topology, equivariant homotopy theory, and motivic homotopy theory.  Equivariant homotopy theory is the study of the topology of symmetry, whereas motivic homotopy theory is the study of the topology of solutions to systems of polynomial equations.  Recent years have witnessed a dazzling array of progress in the field of algebraic topology through the importation of equivariant and motivic methods. Broader impacts of these projects include work with graduate students, a summer math research program, a directed reading program, and a bridge program for entering graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particular projects involve investigating novel structures in equivariant and motivic stable homotopy theory, and seek to leverage these structures to give new approaches to some long outstanding problems in classical stable homotopy theory.  The telescope conjecture will be investigated using a tower of spectra which appeared in the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel solution of the Kervaire Invariant One Problem.  Recent work of Pstragowski and Gheorghe-Isaksen-Krause-Ricka gives a synthetic construction of complex motivic stable homotopy theory.  The principal investigator plans to extend this to the real motivic context using equivariant homotopy theory.  Another project uses equivariant chromatic homotopy theory to study the interaction of classical chromatic homotopy theory with the Tate construction, with the aim of making progress on the chromatic splitting conjecture.  Recent work of Barthel-Schlank-Stapleton gives a means of studying stable homotopy theory at generic primes using ultra-filters.  Computations in this context will be investigated using Drinfeld Modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The PI completed a variety of research projects in chromatic, equivariant, and motivic homotopy theory. Chromatic homotopy theory computes homotopy groups by assembling periodic data, equivariant homotopy theory studies the homotopy theory of spaces with symmetry, and motivic homotopy theory studies the homotopy theory of spaces which are the solutions of polynomial equations.   The PIs work on chromatic homotopy theory was focused on 2-primary v_2-periodic homotopy theory. Currently, we have a fairly good understanding of many aspects of K(2)-local homotopy theory at odd primes, but knowledge is limited at the prime 2. With his collaborators Agnes Beaudry, Prasit Bhattacharya, Dominic Culver, and Zhouli Xu, the PI computed the first 2-primary homotopy groups of a non-trivial K(2)-local finite complex. This involved the development of the Adams spectral sequence based on the theory of Topological Modular Forms (TMF). This computational tool uses the arithmetic of modular forms to compute stable homotopy groups.   The TMF-Adams spectral sequence was further utilized by the PI with JD Quigley to completely determine the TMF-Hurewicz image at the prime 2. The problem of when a sphere admits a unique smooth structure (the smooth Poincare conjecture) is solved in all odd dimensions. The PI and Quigley were able to show that in even dimensions, exotic smooth structures exist in roughly half of the congruence classes of dimensions modulo 192.   A spectral sequence requires a computable input  in the case of the v_2-periodic TMF-Adams spectral sequence the PI, with Bhattacharya and Culver, was able to completely compute this algebraic input. Based on this work, the PI has embarked on a study of the structure of this spectral sequence.   It has been well understood that motivic homotopy theory over the real numbers is closely connected to the homotopy theory of spaces with an involution, as the complex solutions to real polynomial equations possess an action by complex conjugation. There is no analogous story for the cyclic group with p elements, where p is an odd prime. The PI has developed a theory which nevertheless associates an artificial motivic homotopy theory to such a group, with his collaborators Gabriel Angelini-Knoll, Eva Belmont, Maxwell Johnson, and Hana Jia Kong. These artificial motivic categories are constructed with synthetic methods.   With his postdoc Jack Carlisle, the PI has also generalized chromatic homotopy theory to the equivariant context. This theory shows that in the context of group actions, equivariant periodicities give rise to periodicities of different frequencies at the fixed point spaces of various subgroups.   The PI also developed chromatic homotopy theory in the synthetic context. This kind of periodicity extends the periodicity of homotopy groups to periodicity of differentials in the Adams spectral sequences themselves.   During the period of this grant the PI published 2 research articles, and submitted 2 other articles for publication which are still being refereed, and released one preprint.   The PI advised 9 graduate students during the period of this grant, many of which benefitted from support from this grant. Five of these students received their PhD's, and 4 are progressing to graduation.
