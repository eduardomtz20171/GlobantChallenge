<AbstractNarration>Nitrogen pollution causes many environmental and human health problems. These include harmful algal blooms, acid rain and smog. In cities, fossil fuel burning and fertilizer application add large amounts of nitrogen to stormwater. City infrastructure carries stormwater downstream, which may pollute downstream ecosystems with excess nitrogen. Nature-based designs that use ecological processes to remove nitrogen from stormwater may provide a solution. These green infrastructure designs are popular in cities globally. Questions remain, however, about their effectiveness. Should green infrastructure design mimic natural ecosystems as closely as possible? Or can new combinations of soils and species more effectively mitigate pollution? This research will seek answers to these questions by studying several types of stormwater management facilities in Salt Lake City, UT. Results from this research will provide useful guidance to the design of stormwater management systems. It also has the potential to advance fundamental understanding of the nitrogen cycle. Researchers will also conduct extensive public outreach and educational activities to highlight the importance of ecological processes in urban spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific community currently lacks a theoretical framework to guide design of ecosystems that maximize nitrogen retention.  This is due largely to the complexity of nitrogen cycling in ecosystems. The researchers propose to quantify the relative influence of two key paradigms of ecosystem science on nitrogen retention: biodiversity-ecosystem function and thermodynamic ecological stoichiometry. The project will involve quantifying rates of nitrogen retention processes (microbial &amp; plant uptake, plant biomass and soil nitrogen accumulation, and permanent gaseous removal) over event-scale and seasonal-scale in two sets of replicated stormwater management experimental facilities, as well as replicate plots in an adjacent natural area. The first experimental facility includes nine plots planted with three levels of plant functional diversity. The second includes eight plots with two levels of plant community composition: ornamental vs. native, xeric-adapted species.  Researchers hypothesize that plots with high plant diversity and/or xeric-adapted traits will have higher nitrogen retention if physiological traits related to rapid resource acquisition are an important driver of nitrogen cycling. Further, researchers hypothesize that variation in microbial community diversity across plots and over time following plot establishment will correlate with higher nitrogen immobilization and denitrification if biodiversity is an important driver of these processes. Conversely, if biodiversity is not an important driver of ecosystem scale nitrogen fluxes, we expect to find retention rates follow thermodynamic and stoichiometric models without significant variation across plant communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Generalizations about efficiency of green infrastructure (GI) installations for retaining nutrients and reducing runoff largely come from studies in temperate biomes, and often do not correlate microbial diversity to ecological function. We assessed the effect of precipitation pulses amidst a period of moderate drought on microbial community physiology and nitrogen (N) dynamics in the experimental Green Infrastructure Research Facility (GIRF), with 9 plots of 3 replicated plant treatments, as compared to a neighboring protected riparian meadow. We also examined the evolution of microbial community structure and function in the first growing season after construction of the Landscape Lab (LL), an operational 1.5 ha GI site consisting of 8 bioswales with 4 replicates of two distinct plant communities. Finally, we quantified shifts in runoff volume and water quality for the catchments with LL, as compared to a catchment without GI. Precipitation pulses at GIRF and the riparian meadow elevated soil moisture and pH, stimulated ecoenzyme activity, and increased the content of organic matter, proteins, and N pools in soils, despite stasis in microbial community biomass and N assimilation. Differences in soil N concentrations were most directly correlated to changes in organic matter content mediated by ecoenzyme expression and the balance of carbon and nutrient resources available to microbial communities. Irrigation to establish recent plantings at LL elevated soil moisture, concomitant with an increase in the diversity of soil microbial taxa (Shannon-Weiner index) but declines in microbial community biomass, ecoenzyme expression, and pools of soil N. Increased diversity of soil microbial taxa also was apparent over time at GIRF and the riparian meadow, suggesting that microbial communities at LL were responding to seasonal environmental change rather than an evolutionary trajectory post-construction of bioswales. Plant community type had little effect on soil microbial diversity and physiology or soil N dynamics at either GI study site. Diminishing N resources in LL soils over the growing season may have been the result of N assimilation by plants or leaching to stormwater and groundwater. Nutrient and organic carbon concentrations in standing water collected from LL bioswales were higher than runoff source water, supporting leaching as a removal process. Although the LL reduced runoff volume by over 50%, the quality of water draining the LL catchment showed no change with respect to water draining an adjacent catchment lacking GI or to data from the LL catchment prior to LL construction. In sum, our work shows that microbial structure and function within GI soils is dependent on soil properties to a greater extent than plant cover type. Our work also confirms the efficacy of GI for controlling runoff volume, but its effect on water quality depends on the source of runoff collected and the proportion of catchment runoff volume filtered by GI.</p>  <p>This project has produced two publications to date, with two more manuscripts in preparation. Data from publications have been made publicly available in GitHub and HydroShare repositories. The project also has supported the completion of two graduate theses and three undergraduate honors theses. One post-baccalaureate trainee contributed to publications and graduate theses. An additional 9 undergraduates have obtained informal STEM education by engaging in research activities as part of senior capstone projects. Approximately 270 graduate and undergraduate students and over 20 campus and community professionals have learned about the NSF-supported project in tours of the LL and GIRF. Two citizen science events have been hosted in conjunction with the Natural History Museum of Utah, where citizens helped to collect data about evolving plant diversity at the LL. Roughly 30 residents attended these two events in total. Collaboration with Red Butte Garden at the University of Utah led to the creation of a 5th grade lesson plan on green infrastructure, based on Utah Science and Engineering Education (SEEd) standards, and is now offered as a science curriculum resource to elementary educators around the state. A publicly accessible ArcGIS story map has been created as a supplement to the 5th grade lesson plan teaching materials, and to facilitate instruction in secondary and higher education.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 11/30/2024<br> Modified by: Jennifer&nbsp;J&nbsp;Follstad Shah</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2006308/2006308_10663050_1731450784138_LL_layout--rgov-214x142.png" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2006308/2006308_10663050_1731450784138_LL_layout--rgov-800width.png" title="Landscape Lab Study Site"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2006308/2006308_10663050_1731450784138_LL_layout--rgov-66x44.png" alt="Landscape Lab Study Site"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image shows the sources of stormwater runoff to the Landscape Lab, examples of the two vegetative communities planted in four replicates amongst the eight bioswales, and a bioswale with collected stormwater.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jennifer Follstad Shah</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jennifer&nbsp;J&nbsp;Follstad Shah <div class="imageTitle">Landscape Lab Study Site</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2006308/2006308_10663050_1731449341785_GIRF--rgov-214x142.png" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2006308/2006308_10663050_1731449341785_GIRF--rgov-800width.png" title="Green Infrastructure Research Facility Study Site"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2006308/2006308_10663050_1731449341785_GIRF--rgov-66x44.png" alt="Green Infrastructure Research Facility Study Site"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This image shows the nine study plots at the Green Infrastructure Research Facility (GIRF) study site.
