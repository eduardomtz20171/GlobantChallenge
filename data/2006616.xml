<AbstractNarration>The overall objective of the project is to leverage the principles of evolution in order to develop a new type of complex soft robots (robots that are constructed from compliant material) that can change their shape and mechanical properties to assume different forms in order to overcome environmental challenges such as uneven terrain.  The motivation comes from the ways animals achieve efficient locomotion in their habitats by varying body shape and mechanical properties as a result of evolution over millions of years.  Based on prior numerical results, the investigators hypothesize that highly adaptable locomotion can be achieved when given enough complexity in terms of shape deformation and mechanical properties.  Current bioinspired soft robots, however, have limited capability to investigate such hypothesis. One key goal in this proposal is to develop innovative soft robotic platforms to study, for the first time, these numerical findings. The planned research has the potential to significantly enhance the functionality, adaptability, and versality of high-dimensional soft robots. The broader impact would be significant in several areas where soft robots have shown promise, particularly in inspection operations and search-and-rescue missions. The project is also expected to have a significant educational impact by engaging undergraduate students in the planned research activities and developing course content and new courses geared towards soft robots. Outreach efforts focus on workshops, public lectures, and engagements with elementary, middle, and high schools to foster collaborations with the local communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned research is poised to unlock the evolutionary secrets of biological systems and open the door for the next generation of energy-efficient, adaptable, versatile, and human-friendly robots. To meet these goals, investigators propose to develop novel transformable and stiffness controllable soft robots and apply evolutionary computing to generate optimal morphological and stiffness trajectories for locomotion. The investigators employ evolutionary computing-based learning models to circumvent the curse of dimensionality associated with complex soft robotic systems and develop a comprehensive framework for developing optimal and robust control schemes and testing thereof using a series of rigorous experimental evaluations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project developed the building blocks to model, fabricate, and control a transformable soft robot composed of interconnected high-dimensional, soft robotic modules.     The project was broken up into three research components that played to the strengths of the partner institutions in this collaborative research award. These research focus areas include    Designing, modeling, and prototyping of modular, high-dimensional soft robots.  Establishing a formal methodology for applying evolutionary computing to learn and refine optimal locomotion patterns for the soft robot.  Validating the capabilities of high-dimensional soft robots in addressing complex environmental challenges.      Vanderbilt University (PI Galloway) contributed to the first research focus area by exploring multiple manufacturing methods (additive manufacturing, molding and casting, fabric-based), materials, and designs to assemble multi-degree of freedom soft robotic modules. For example, within additive manufacturing, FDM printing soft actuators with TPU and TPE (50A-92A) filament and digital light projection printing technology were explored. Multi-degree of freedom bellow-type soft modules were also molded and casted from 3D printed molds. Ultimately, fabric-base soft actuator modules demonstrated the greatest range of performance from very flexible in the unactuated state to rigid with the greatest change in shape in the actuated state. During the course of this project, graduate students from PI Godages lab (Texas A&M University) visited Vanderbilt University several times for one-on-one training and knowledge transfer, which was then reproduced in PI Godages lab for further modeling and experimental validation.
