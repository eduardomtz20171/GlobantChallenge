<AbstractNarration>The problem of reconstructing text strings from their fragments or masses of fragments is of focal importance in computational biology as current DNA and protein sequencing platforms are unable to read the content of long strings that denote protein/gene sequences. One prototypical example of string reconstruction arises in DNA assembly: there, one creates multiple copies of the same long string and cuts the copies to read out short overlapping substrings that can be put together by matching their prefixes and suffixes. The reconstructed string may not be a perfect replica of the original string due to errors in the fragmentation and matching processes. Furthermore, for many strings unique reconstruction is inherently impossible. This represents a major issue for next generation sequencing technologies used in fundamental biological research, since in this setting it is impossible to ensure unambiguous results. The successful code designs pursued in this project can resolve reliability and content retrieval issues impeding implementations of emerging molecular computing and storage paradigms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with developing novel coding methods for unique reconstruction of strings or pools of strings based on their constituent substrings, subsequences and substring compositions. The techniques employed represent a combination of new graph-theoretic, combinatorial optimization and information theory approaches. In particular, the project will investigate the use of balanced partial de Bruijn strings for substring-based reconstruction, Catalan-like paths for multiset composition reconstruction as well as coded multi-trace reconstruction methods involving specialized modifications of deletion-correcting codes and superposition codes. The coding schemes will be tested on DNA-based and synthetic polymer-based data storage platforms under the development at the University of Illinois.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The project acomplished it goals to develop methods and results on strings including porblems of  substring search and learning with private data.   In particular:  1. We study the so called subsequence pattern matching also known as hidden pattern matching in which one searches for a given pattern w of length m as a subsequence in a random text of length n. The quantity of interest is the number of occurrences of w as a subsequence (i.e., occurring in not necessarily consecutive text locations). This problem finds many applications from intrusion detection, to trace reconstruction, to deletion channel, and to DNA-based storage systems. In all of these applications, the pattern w is of variable length. To the best of our knowledge this problem was only tackled for a fixed length m=O(1). In our main result we prove that for m=o(n^{1/3}) the number of subsequence occurrences is normally distributed. In addition, we show that under some constraints on the structure of w the asymptotic normality can be extended to m=o(\sqrt{n}). For a special pattern w consisting of the same symbol, we indicate that for m=o(n) the distribution of number of subsequences is either asymptotically normal or asymptotically log normal. After studying some special patterns (e.g., alternating) we conjecture that this dichotomy is true for all patterns. We use Hoeffding's projection method for U-statistics to prove our findings.   2. We extedned our stochastic model to the so called "smooth model" which allows depedency on strings which is controled by the smooth paramter sigma.   3. We analyzed some machien learning probelms and AI problems with privacy constratins that may have impact on applications of strings models.   4. In our book "Analytic Information Theory" From Compression to Learning" we presented a systematic approaches to problems on string, including compression, using precise and sophisticed tools of analytic combinatorics in which discrete problems are solved using complex analysis.
