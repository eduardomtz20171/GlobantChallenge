<AbstractNarration>Finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix is among the most&lt;br/&gt;fundamental computational tasks. These quantities correspond to resonant&lt;br/&gt;frequencies and modes of physical, statistical, and mathematical systems and&lt;br/&gt;appear in essentially every area of science and engineering. First year&lt;br/&gt;college students are taught how to compute them on small examples, and two of&lt;br/&gt;the ``top 10 algorithms of the twentieth century'' --- the QR Algorithm and&lt;br/&gt;the Arnoldi algorithm ---  were designed to do so on large instances. When the&lt;br/&gt;matrices involved are symmetric, these methods come with provable guarantees&lt;br/&gt;showing that they are accurate, fast, and correct. However, the general&lt;br/&gt;non-symmetric case remains poorly understood, and rigorously analyzing these&lt;br/&gt;algorithms in general has been a decades-old mystery in numerical analysis,&lt;br/&gt;despite their being implemented in standard software packages. The main goal&lt;br/&gt;of this project is to solve these and related mysteries using modern tools of&lt;br/&gt;random-matrix theory and theoretical computer science. Doing so will put a&lt;br/&gt;large branch of computational practice on solid theoretical footing, and&lt;br/&gt;ideally foster deeper interaction between the numerical analysis, mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;and theoretical computer science research communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project will aim to analyze the two (currently heuristic)&lt;br/&gt;algorithms mentioned above, with the following concrete major goals: (1) find&lt;br/&gt;a shifting strategy for the shifted QR method which provably converges rapidly&lt;br/&gt;for every matrix; (2) formalize a widely held belief precisely relating the&lt;br/&gt;output of the Arnoldi algorithm to the pseudospectrum of the input matrix.&lt;br/&gt;Secondarily, the award will study the adjacent problem of efficiently&lt;br/&gt;computing an approximation of the Jordan normal form of a given rational&lt;br/&gt;matrix in the variable precision model of computation, for which good&lt;br/&gt;complexity bounds are not known.  The project will likely use techniques from&lt;br/&gt;random-matrix theory, dynamical systems, algebra, and numerical analysis,&lt;br/&gt;building on recent progress of the investigator and collaborators in some of&lt;br/&gt;these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
