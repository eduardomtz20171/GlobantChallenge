<AbstractNarration>The population of students who are emergent bilinguals in the US is not only growing in number but also, historically, has been underrepresented in STEM fields. Emergent bilingual students have not had access to the same high-quality science education as their peers, despite bringing rich academic, linguistic and cultural strengths to their learning. Building on smaller pilot studies and ideas that have shown to be successful in supporting emergent bilingual students’ learning of elementary science, this project seeks to support emergent bilingual students in high school biology classrooms. The project team will study how teachers make sense of and use an instructional model that builds on students’ cultural and linguistic strengths to teach biology in ways that are responsive. The team will also study how such a model impacts emergent bilingual students’ learning of biology and scientific language practices, as well as how it supports students’ identities as knowers/doers of science. The collaboration will include two partner districts that will allow the project work to impact about 11,000 high school students and 30 biology teachers in Florida. Over time, the project team plans to enact and study three cohorts of teachers and students; use the information learned to improve the instructional model; and develop lessons, a website, and other materials that can be applied to other contexts to support emergent bilingual students’ learning of biology. This project will increase emergent bilingual students’ participation in biology classes, improve their achievement and engagement in science and engineering practices, extend current research-based practices, and document how to build on emergent bilingual students’ strengths and prior experiences.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In two previous pilot studies through the collaboration of an interdisciplinary team, the project team developed an instructional model that they found supported emergent bilingual students to have high-quality opportunities for science learning. The model builds on research related to culturally responsive instruction; funds of knowledge (including work on identity affirmation and collaboration); and linguistically responsive instruction (including using students’ home languages and multiple modalities, and explicit attention to academic language). Using design-based research, the project team will gather data from two primary settings: their professional development program and biology teachers’ classrooms. They will use these data both to improve the instructional model and professional development for biology teachers. Additionally, the project team will study how teachers use the model to support emergent bilingual students’ biology engagement and achievement, as well as study how biology teachers enact the instructional model in two school districts. The project will work toward three main outcomes: a) to develop new knowledge related to how diverse learners develop language and content knowledge in biology through engaging in science and engineering practices; b) to generate new knowledge about how biology teachers can adapt responsive instruction to local contexts and student populations; and c) to articulate an instructional model for biology teachers of emergent bilingual students that is rigorous, yet practical. The dissemination and sustainability include publishing and presenting findings at a range of conferences and journals; making available the refined instructional framework and professional development materials on a website; communication with district leaders and policymakers; and white papers that can be more widely distributed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Responsive Instruction for Emergent Bilingual Learners in Biology Classrooms</em> (&ldquo;RIEL&rdquo;)<em> </em>(DRL 2010153) supported 27 biology teachers and 550 students across 3 Florida districts. RIEL had three goals: (1) Iteratively refine the RIEL Instructional Framework, (2) Understand how the RIEL Instructional Framework supports multilingual learners&rsquo; engagement and achievement in biology, (3) Study how teachers enact the RIEL Instructional Framework across contexts.</p> <p>RIEL mentored 6 graduate assistants and led to 5 doctoral dissertations, 1 master&rsquo;s thesis, 5 published articles, 8 manuscripts under review, and 30 presentations at professional conferences. Our teacher training (&ldquo;professional development,&rdquo; PD) program has received interest from 7 additional Florida districts and is an open-access program available through our existing project website. Our website also houses 21 exemplary teacher-created RIEL lessons. RIEL has been highlighted by NSF&rsquo;s CADRE for excellence in STEM education. Key findings according to project goals are reported.</p> <p><strong><em>Goal 1: RIEL Instructional Framework Refinement</em></strong></p> <p>Our team developed the RIEL Observation Protocol (RIEL-OP), which measures when biology teachers use the 6 RIEL instructional Elements in their classroom instruction. These Elements (or techniques) are: <em>Affirming Students&rsquo; Science Identities, Attention to Science Language, Funds of Knowledge, Meaningful Collaboration, Multiple Modalities, </em>and <em>Sociopolitical Consciousness</em>.</p> <p>The RIEL-OP allows us to measure the 6 RIEL instructional Elements in a way that includes attention to science content and practices, allowing us to comprehensively evaluate culturally and linguistically responsive biology instruction. We ensured the RIEL-OP accurately measured the 6 RIEL Elements. We undertook several steps to ensure this, including a thorough review of the literature, conducting teacher focus groups, engaging with content experts in a panel review, and consulting with a specialist who designs similar instruments.</p> <p>We watched 100 biology and marine biology classes taught by RIEL teachers. We found that the current RIEL-OP tool mostly works well, but it is better at measuring some RIEL Elements than others. Figure 1 shows the model resulting from our analysis. &nbsp;<em>Collaboration, Funds of Knowledge </em>and<em> Multiple Modalities</em> were mostly reliable. <em>Affirming Identities</em> was the most consistent Element, while <em>Attention to Language</em> was less so. There weren't enough examples of teaching <em>Sociopolitical Consciousness</em> to properly judge it. Overall, the RIEL-OP tool was fairly reliable, scoring 0.7 out of 1 (maximum).</p> <p><strong><em>Goal 2: How RIEL Instruction Supports MLs&rsquo; Science Achievement and Engagement</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>We found that how often teachers used <em>Funds of Knowledge</em> is linked to improvements in multilingual learners&rsquo; biology grades. Specifically, multilingual learners whose teachers frequently used this technique showed better science grades in the 3rd Quarter compared to the 1st Quarter (&beta; = 0.339, S.E.= 0.101, p &lt; 0.001). This relationship was statistically significant, meaning it is unlikely to be due to chance. Our team also found that the effect of RIEL instruction significantly differs between teachers in school districts, suggesting that local factors may influence how well this approach works in different areas.</p> <p>We also learned that teachers sometimes struggled with understanding science practices and their relation to RIEL Elements, thus prompting us to examine two exemplary teachers. Both teachers spent approximately 69% of their instructional time across all lessons using one or more RIEL Elements. These exemplary teachers frequently used RIEL Elements in combination with each other, such as during a lesson on macromolecules (Fig. 2). Students of these teachers participated in science practices every time RIEL instruction was used, with an average of 2.6 science practices per RIEL Element. The science practice &ldquo;<em>Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information</em>&rdquo; overlapped almost entirely with RIEL instruction, followed by the science practice &ldquo;<em>Developing and Using Models</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>Analyzing and Interpreting Data</em>.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong><em>Goal 3: How Biology Teachers Enact RIEL Instruction</em></strong></p> <p>When analyzing the 100 classroom videos, we wanted to see how teachers used RIEL Elements. On average, we saw about 18 examples of RIEL techniques in each teacher&rsquo;s lessons. The most common Element was <em>Multiple Modalities</em>. This happened about 7 times per class. &nbsp;<em>Collaboration</em>, or students working together, was the second most frequent Element, occurring about 4 times per class. We saw less of other RIEL Elements like <em>Sociopolitical Consciousness</em>, <em>Funds of Knowledge</em>, and <em>Affirming Identities</em> which occurred about twice per class.<em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p><em></em>Our teacher training program (&ldquo;PD&rdquo;) significantly increased the use of RIEL Elements after specific online lessons. When we taught about <em>Funds of Knowledge</em> (using students' home and community experiences in class), teachers used this method four times more often than before (Fig. 3). Teachers used the RIEL Element, S<em>ociopolitical Consciousness</em>, nearly five times more often after learning about it.</p> <p><em>This Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award.
