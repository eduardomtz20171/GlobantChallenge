<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Integrative Research Investigating the Rules of Life Governing Interactions Between Genomes, Environment and Phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. To perceive and interact with their worlds, all organisms depend on a host of sensory abilities that evolved to meet the specific demands of the organism’s lifestyle. Among animals these senses are mediated by specialized organs that evolved to detect certain stimuli, such as eyes for light and ears for sound. These organs contain specialized cells that detect a specific stimulus and then transmit that information onward to the animal’s nervous system to enable specific behavioral responses. While many animals share a common set of sensory organs such as eyes and ears, some sensory specialists have acquired unique sensory abilities through the evolution of novel sensory organs that provide a competitive advantage in certain environments. One such organism is the sea robin, which is a fish that has evolved six leg-like appendages with sensory properties that enable it to locate prey buried in the sea floor. These legs are thought to sense both chemical and mechanical stimuli, but the cells and molecules that endow sea robin legs with sensory abilities have not been identified, and the developmental basis for the evolution of the legs is unknown. The goals of this research are to identify the molecules, cells, and developmental programs that have enabled the evolution of these specialized sensory appendages. By examining the physiology, evolution and development of these unusual sensory organs, this research will contribute to the understanding of the diverse mechanisms that underlie sensory processes, and more broadly illuminate the relationship between sensory systems and evolution. Beyond the scientific merit, the impact of this work will be broadened through the training and inclusion of new scientists, and through scientific outreach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project spans hierarchical levels of biological organization to link the structure and function of proteins, cells, and tissues with the specific, niche-defining animal behaviors they enable. First, sensory receptors and cells in the sensory legs will be identified using genetic approaches including bulk-tissue and single-cell transcriptional profiling (Aim1). Next, the mechanisms of sensory signal transduction used in leg-localized sensory cells will be investigated using biophysical approaches including patch-clamp electrophysiology in combination with quantitative behavioral analysis of live sea robins (Aim 2). Finally, the developmental basis for the evolution of sensory legs will be examined in developing sea robins through techniques including RNA sequencing and histology, with the goal of uncovering the origins of their sensory cells and elucidating the genetic blueprint underlying their unique morphology (Aim 3). Broader impacts of the project include student mentoring and outreach to increase public understanding of science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
