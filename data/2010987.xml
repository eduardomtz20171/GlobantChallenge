<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Understanding biodiversity is critical for the proper conservation of an ecosystem that is experiencing extreme stress from global change during the modern age. Few other ecosystems are at such high risk of disappearing, especially due to logging and agricultural activities, as the Chaine de la Selle/Sierra de Bahoruco mountain range in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. This proposal will use novel approaches of examining genetic and trait diversity from herbarium specimens to better understand this region. The ultimate goals of this project are to (i) emphasize the dire need to protect the remaining natural areas from further damage and (ii) highlight suitable methods for understanding the evolutionary biology of critically endangered ecosystems. Identifying patterns across the vastly different ecosystems in this endemism hotspot will highlight important areas and plants requiring conservation efforts for future preservation, allowing conservationists to tailor protocols specific to remaining habitats to ensure the well-being of what remains of the mountain rangesâ€™ ecosystems, leading to collaborations with conservation organizations and policy makers. The Fellow will also mentor students from groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines in scientific investigation as well as creating educational opportunities for K-12 students through summer workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide insights into factors that formed and maintained habitats with high levels of endemicity, in addition to understanding the role microclimates have on species functional traits across communities. A well-resolved phylogeny will allow us to elucidate the evolutionary history of the vascular plants in this region and determine whether paleo-endemism or neo-endemism led to the current pattern of species richness, in addition to discovering endemism hotspots within the mountain range. Herbarium specimens will be crucial to understanding historical phylogenetic and functional trait diversity across the mountain range. The Fellow will collaborate with the UF Biodiversity Institute and the RISE Precollege Summer Educational Program to organize summer workshops to educate middle and high school students about the anthropogenic impact on our tropical forests. Training goals for the Fellow include learning methods in biological informatics, ecological modeling, and educational outreach including both undergraduate and pre-collegiate teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project focused on understanding biodiversity in the face of global change, particularly in the Massif de la Hotte and the Massif de la Selle in Haiti, located at the center of the Caribbean Biodiversity Hotspot. This region is highly vulnerable to logging and agriculture, posing a significant threat to its ecosystems. Using the diverse tropical plant family Melastomataceae as a study subject, specifically Miconieae, we discovered that the mountains of Eastern Cuba were a major source of the species diversity observed in the southern peninsula of Hispaniola, with an estimated 19 independent dispersal events recovered from the eastern ranges of Cuba onto the Massif de la Hotte and Massif de la Selle. By analyzing historical and geographic factors, we uncovered several hotspots of endemism and high evolutionary diversity, areas that are of maximum priority for conservation efforts. In the Greater Antilles, the endemism analyses highlight areas of mixed endemism, emphasizing the need to combine conservation strategies for both museums and cradles of biodiversity. The study finds that a significant portion of identified endemism hotspots aligns with protected areas, yet a notable percentage lacks coverage, particularly in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Conservation challenges are underscored, such as forest loss in national parks and threats to cloud forests, suggesting a need for nuanced approaches, possibly adapting protected zones to include adjacent endemism-significant areas. These results emphasize the importance of spatial biodiversity analysis in identifying and conserving areas with evolutionary significance, crucial for understanding diversification processes and species lineage persistence. Traditional measures like species richness fall short in capturing the need for conservation efforts, lacking distinctions between native and non-native species, and providing limited information on endemism, rarity, function, and sensitivity to anthropogenic changes. Overall, the study advocates for a more comprehensive conservation strategy that considers finer-scale diversity patterns for effective preservation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 02/29/2024<br> Modified by: Andre&nbsp;A&nbsp;Naranjo</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2010987/2010987_10680469_1709151760230_Figure_3--rgov-214x142.png" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2010987/2010987_10680469_1709151760230_Figure_3--rgov-800width.png" title="Biogeographic Patterns in Miconieae"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2010987/2010987_10680469_1709151760230_Figure_3--rgov-66x44.png" alt="Biogeographic Patterns in Miconieae"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Biogeographical reconstruction using DEC+J for select clades of Greater Antillean Miconieae based on the RaXML phylogeny dated with TreePL.
