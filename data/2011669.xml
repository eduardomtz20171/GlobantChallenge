<AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities for students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be locally relevant, and encourages a faculty community to look beyond the traditional classroom for intellectual and professional growth. This project aligns directly with that goal, allowing the institution's faculty and administrators to design and develop a comprehensive plan for improving and expanding STEM instruction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Red Lake Nation College (RLNC) serves the Red Lake Reservation in Minnesota.  The project leaders will conduct deliberate assessment and exploration of needs, capacity, interests, and opportunities in the region in order to develop its own STEM vision, goals, and a strategic plan. The project will entail 3 phases: Phase 1 will consist of information gathering about RLNC, community, and regional employer capacity, needs, and interests. Phase 2 will consist of exploring TCU STEM programming success and possible collaborations with various institutions in the region and around the country. Phase 3 will consist of compiling and analyzing the data gathered in phases 1 and 2 and then developing an RLNC STEM vision, goals, and strategic plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
