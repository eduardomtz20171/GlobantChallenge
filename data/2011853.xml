<AbstractNarration>Catalyst Projects provide support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) to work towards establishing research capacity of faculty to strengthen science, technology, engineering and mathematics undergraduate education and research. It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences. The project at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) seeks to increase undergraduate matriculation in the institutionâ€™s Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering program.  The PI intends to implement integrative persistence models that are specific to the department, enhance mathematics education, and recruit and retain more students who are typically underrepresented in the discipline.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project incorporates next generation educational directions for employing evidence-based active STEM learning practices targeting perseverance in Freshman and Sophomores (Froshmores).  The specific objectives of the project are (1) to understand the role of augmented reality in conceptualized learning of calculus for STEM targeted skill attainment in the Froshmore years, (2) to assist with research integration for acquiring critical thinking skills, and (3) to provide industry advocacy as an enhanced professional student model level to improve retention of Froshmore students at FAMU. The methods employ targeted inclusion and retention of women through a two-semester course incorporating (1) inductive learning techniques and (2) course-based undergraduate research experiences, also known as CUREs. Novel learning practices, such as augmented reality tools (e.g. guided book and media materials) are used to created conceptualized math curriculum for learning and retention.  The FAMU Catalyst award will assess the impact of the program on guiding Froshmores through nascent STEM careers. The project will use evidence-based, critical-thinking assessments to educate faculty about continuous improvement needs of the curriculum and engage students in active problem-solving scenarios. A broader element of the project is the Industry advocacy panel (community engagement) which will assist in student mentorship, badge certifications and provide research-based projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Evidenced-based research in educational training was utilized to implement a 'Two-Semester Catalyst Sequence' project aimed to increase student interest in engineering, particularly in Industrial Engineering, and enhance STEM exposure for non-engineering majors. The project also focused on improving math-related skills (typically denoted as determining factors for freshman/sophomores) and addressing departmental challenges. Key activities included hands-on engagement through calculus reinforcement and lab training to boost retention rates in Industrial Engineering and the College of Engineering. Specific objectives included studying retention rates post-intervention, assessing the impact of critical thinking tools on engineering courses, and examining the role of mentorship in STEM major decisions. A significant achievement was the integration of robotic process automation (RPA) concepts into the curriculum, a first in the nation at an HBCU. This integration was timely, given the growing interest in RPA and the need for skilled workers in this area. The project also saw a approximately 25-30% retention rate of activities in the Industrial Engineering major or research operations, with a goal of a 10% conversion rate of non-engineering majors to Industrial Engineering. However, the effect of cohort was not determined to have large effect when the participant body was of mixed or undecided majors. Although, course-integrations of recitations is a proven model to help students obtain confidence and practice critical thinking skills. The project provided training in Matlab, Python, RPA, and other technical skills, with partnerships that offered a global perspective on workforce skills. Results were disseminated through material handouts, online modules, and conference presentations. Plans included a website launch for course offerings and advertisements, as well as introducing new demos, problem sets, and videos for equipment modules given as STEM kits in class. The project aimed to continue increasing student interest in engineering and STEM fields through course structure, mentorship and extracurricular research activities with significant impact in keeping HBCU students engaged. Other broader impacts included conducting K-12 outreach, encouraging undergraduates to engage in industry research, and presenting work at conferences. Overall, the project has made a significant impact on student training and coaching, improving math skills, and fostering interest in engineering and STEM fields.
