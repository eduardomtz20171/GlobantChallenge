<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Southern University (SU) will enhance undergraduate STEM education by establishing the SU-Computing and Data Education (SU-CoDE) program to equip computer science, as well as other STEM majors, with computing and analytical skills across a range of contexts, disciplines, and problems.  The project activities can serve as a model for other institutions that desire to strengthen undergraduate education in the area of computer and data science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of SU-CoDE are to: enhance the role of the computing curriculum to have short- and long-term impacts on non-CS STEM programs; improve access to computational research experiences for undergraduate students to educate qualified STEM graduates for the workforce or graduate school; increase the interest, broaden participation, and thereby improve recruitment and retention of African American students in STEM fields; improve students’ transition from K-12 to undergraduate and undergraduate to graduate school; and enhance collaborations, partnerships, and professional developments to promote the research capacity of STEM faculty in computing and data science. A team of faculty from all STEM departments at the institution will be involved in this project. The project is guided by an external evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Southern University Computing and Data Education (SU-CoDE) project has made significant strides in enhancing STEM education and broadening participation in computational and data science fields. This report summarizes the key outcomes and broader impacts achieved throughout the life of the award.   The SU-CoDE project aimed to integrate computational and data science into non-computer science curricula, providing students across various STEM disciplines with the tools and knowledge needed to address complex, real-world problems. To achieve this, the project proposed a certificate program, developed and implemented new interdisciplinary courses, such as "Mathematical Foundations of Cryptography and Computer Security," "Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity for Additive Manufacturing," and "Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity Law and Policy."   These courses have enriched the educational experiences of students by offering them practical applications of computational techniques in their respective fields. Additionally, the project facilitated hands-on research opportunities, where over 200 students engaged in cutting-edge projects that spanned multiple STEM disciplines. These initiatives not only enhanced students' technical skills but also fostered critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and a deeper understanding of the relevance of computational methods in today's data-driven world.   One of the most significant broader impacts of the SU-CoDE project has been its focus on increasing diversity and inclusion within the STEM fields. The project specifically targeted underrepresented minority students, providing them with opportunities to gain valuable skills and experience in computational and data science. Through outreach activities, such as high school mentorship programs, STEM nights, and participation in career days, SU-CoDE successfully engaged a diverse group of students, inspiring them to pursue STEM education and careers.   Moreover, SU-CoDEs collaboration with industry partners, including the National Lab, established a strong pipeline from education to employment. This partnership provided students with internships, real-world research experiences, and job opportunities, effectively preparing them for the competitive STEM workforce. The acquisition of advanced research equipment, such as high-performance computers and 3D printers, further bolstered the programs capacity to offer state-of-the-art training and research opportunities.   The project also emphasized the importance of ethical considerations in technology development. By integrating discussions on cybersecurity, AI ethics, and the societal implications of technology into the curriculum, SU-CoDE has helped shape a generation of students who are not only technically proficient but also mindful of the broader impacts of their work on society.   Summary of Outcomes  Curriculum Development: SU-CoDE successfully developed and implemented      interdisciplinary courses that integrated computational and data science      into various STEM fields, enhancing students' educational experiences. Research Opportunities: The project provided hands-on research experiences for      over 200 students, leading to significant student achievements, including awards      at national conferences. Industry Collaboration: The partnership with the National Lab and other industry      collaborators created a strong pipeline for students, offering them      internships, research opportunities, and job placements. Infrastructure Enhancement: The acquisition of high-performance computers and 3D      printers significantly improved the university's research infrastructure,      supporting a wide range of interdisciplinary projects. Ethical Training: The project integrated discussions on ethics and societal impacts into the      curriculum, preparing students to be responsible and thoughtful leaders in      the field of technology.    Overall, the SU-CoDE project has had a lasting impact on the Southern University community and beyond, contributing to the development of a diverse, skilled, and ethically conscious STEM workforce ready to tackle the challenges of the 21st century.
