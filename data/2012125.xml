<AbstractNarration>Interactions among a few atoms will be explored by this project, and in particular, ways to achieve quantum control in the regime of ultracold temperatures where a gas becomes quantum mechanical in nature. Few-atom systems with their extremely nonperturbative interactions pose some of the greatest challenges for atomic theorists and provide many opportunities to advance our scientific knowledge with potential technological and fundamental impacts. This project represents a theoretical and experimental collaboration via the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF). The goal of the project is to develop the theoretical tools, which, combined with experimental analysis, will enable a detailed investigation of properties of strongly interacting quantum gases with a focal point on developing control of the complex multichannel collision dynamics using either a static external field or an electromagnetic field.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A specific goal is to explore 7Li ultracold quantum gases to understand puzzling observations related to the nature of the universality of Efimov states in the system. These studies will serve as the base of the main focus of this theory-experiment collaboration, which involves the exploration of new physics near the 7Li ultra-narrow Feshbach resonance and atom-dimer mixtures. Particular attention will be given on the determination of the scattering properties and lifetime of Efimov states as well as the underlying physical mechanisms which make 7Li gases a unique system to explore universal quantum physics. The project also includes studies for the implementation of coherent control over few-body processes which can enable the stabilization of strongly interacting gases, by turning off few-body losses, as well as open up ways to control three-body interactions and superposition states, allowing for the creation of exotic dynamical regimes. Beyond that, a deeper understanding of the ultracold atom interactions can spawn applications to atomic clocks, quantum information science, and the exploration of many novel phases of matter. The key educational impact of this work derives from the training of graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art theoretical and computational research techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
