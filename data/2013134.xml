<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award will push the frontier of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino astrophysics above 100 peta-electron-volts (PeV) with the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) testbed at the South Pole Station, whose dataset is now large enough to enable either a discovery of the highest energy neutrinos ever detected or setting the worldâ€™s best constraints in this crucial energy regime.  The study will continue operation of this testbed experiment, doubling the size of the dataset in the next three years, streamline neutrino searches in the growing ARA dataset, calibrate simulations of neutrino detectors using newly-detected cosmic ray air showers, and test next-generation data acquisition electronics in the South Pole environment.  ARA serves as a platform for recruitment of young scientists into STEM fields, and the development of junior scientists to work on the next generation of UHE neutrino detectors.  This group engages secondary-school, undergraduate and graduate students in innovative neutrino research, and will develop a new module for the Masterclass for high school students on big data strategies to search for rare events in large datasets, using data from ARA and from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The radio technique used by ARA allows astrophysics to extend to these UHE neutrinos.  ARA is laying the groundwork for the radio component of the next generation of neutrino observatories.  A neutrino observation from ARA will constrain the properties of any global population of sources of the highest energy cosmic rays, complementing cosmic ray experiments that sample only local sources at the highest energies.  Any event detected would be the highest energy neutrino ever observed, cosmic or terrestrial, and be the first-ever detection of a neutrino via radio frequency emission.  This would be a major event in the pursuit of UHE neutrinos, and would provide crucial information for the technical design of future facilities.  This project advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an antenna array at South Pole with the greatest sensitivity to the flux of neutrinos from astrophysical sources at the highest energies. These neutrinos are a crucial missing piece in multi-messenger astrophysics and important for unraveling the mystery of the sources of the highest energy particles in the universe. The five stations of ARA antennas span ~10 km^2 at up to 200m depth in the ice This award focused on operating, monitoring, and making improvements to the ARA detector during a crucial period when ARAs dataset was doubling in size, thereby reaching unchartered territory in the search for the most energetic astrophysical neutrinos. ARA operations is led by graduate students from collaborating institutions, providing important professional development, with contributions from all participating institutions.  An ARA student-led ``boot camp'' provided important training for students new to the field.      In the 2022-2023 Austral Summer, important ARA maintenance was performed at South Pole by members of the ARA team at South Pole. Electronics from two stations were returned to institutions in the north for repair and for upgrade to a novel next-generation, more dynamic system. In addition, pulsers were made to emit signals for calibrating the stations, and there was a precise timing system installed that will enable precise searches for neutrinos detected in coincidence between the ARA and IceCube experiments, which would be an unmistakable signal of a discovery of neutrinos having interacted in the ice.      In addition, members of the ARA team have made important advancements in modeling and in tools important for searches for neutrinos in the ARA dataset. Important insights were made about the properties of South Pole ice and their impact on the propagation of radio frequencies impulses over long distances. This will impact experiments across the field of high energy neutrino astrophysics and glaciology.      Results were reported to international conference and disseminated to the astrophysics communities as well as the broader scientific community and the public.  The project provided important training opportunities for a diverse group of early career scientists who are now taking leadership roles in the detector most sensitive to the flux of ultra-high energy astrophysical neutrinos.
