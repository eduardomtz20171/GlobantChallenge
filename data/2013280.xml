<AbstractNarration>Coastal flooding is one of the most dangerous and damaging natural hazards that societies face, and coastal development and climate change are causing a dramatic rise in vulnerability.  Since the 19th century, estuary channels have typically been deepened and widened by a factor of two or three, harbor entrances have been deepened and streamlined, and a large proportion of wetlands have been filled over and replaced with neighborhoods.  Such geomorphic changes increase flood risk by reducing natural resistance to storm surge and tides.  Similarly, sea level rise and climate-modulated variations in storm characteristics such as intensity, size and track path also alter flood risk.  The overarching goal of the proposed research project is to reveal and contrast the mechanisms by which these geomorphic and climatic changes alter flood risk.  This goal will be met using a combination of computational modeling, historical climate and storm surge data analysis, and theory-based synthesis.  The study will provide support for a postdoctoral research associate and several graduate students and undergraduates, including underrepresented groups.  It will improve the well-being of communities within urbanized harbors and estuaries by highlighting coastal development practices that can worsen coastal flooding.  The project plan increases scientific literacy and engagement, and connects the research to applications through interactions with local stakeholders and governments, as well as the US Geological Survey and the US Army Corps of Engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will improve the understanding and separation of climatic and geomorphic factors in coastal flooding through several elements of novel research and technical innovation.  The investigators will use a unique tide-gauge data set that extends back to the 19th century together with contemporary, retrospective, and idealized hydrodynamic models to elucidate system sensitivities.  Well-known, simplified insights into tidal dynamics will be tested for storm surge, then used to help interpret how altered local topography, bathymetry and wetland area have changed frictional damping and long-wave mechanics.  A combined analysis of climate, storm characteristics, and morphologic change will identify the modes and pathways through which climate variability and bathymetric change modulate storms surges.  Advanced non-stationary univariate and multivariate statistical models will be developed and employed to incorporate these changes and assess how statistical properties relevant for coastal design and risk assessments respond.  A flood model inter-comparison workshop will help quantify relevant modeling sensitivities, which will help to improve estuary and floodplain predictions for the academic and operational forecasting community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The increased flood hazard caused by sea level rise and U.S. coastal population growth are well known. This project focused on the less studied issue of how flooding in estuaries is changing due to geomorphic changes such as dredging and climatic variability (and change). Storm surge and coastal flooding depend on both far-field forcing (meteorological, oceanographic) and on local characteristics (estuary bathymetry, floodplain land cover). As a result, changes to any of these factors may greatly influence flood hazard. Our research shows that local changes are significant and impactful:in many locations. Since the 19th century, estuary channels have typically been deepened and widened by a factor of two or three, harbor entrances have been deepened and streamlined, and a large proportion of wetlands have been lost to landfill development. Our research shows that such geomorphic changes, which can be referred to as estuary urbanization, increase flood risk by reducing the natural friction experienced by storm surge and tides. Similarly, sea level rise, natural (astronomically-forced) variations in tides, and variable storm characteristics such as storm track, speed, or size also alter flood risk.   The results of this project are helping to show that estuary urbanization can significantly impact flood hazards, worsening both storm surge and high-tide flooding. Increases in tidal amplitudes are exacerbating nuisance ("high tide") flooding at nearly half of the long-term measurement sites evaluated (18 of 40 NOAA gauges). The number of nuisance floods was 27% higher in 2019 at those 18 locations than it would have been without tidal amplitude increases (Li et al. 2021). Our evidence and computer modeling show that any hurricane storm surge affecting parts of New York City (Orton et al. 2020), Jacksonville (Talke et al. 2021), Wilmington (Familkhalili et al. 2016), Philadelphia (Familkhalili et al., 2020, 2022), and South Florida (de Leo et al. 2022), among other locations, will likely produce higher water levels due to estuary urbanization, potentially causing more damage in unprotected regions.

In Boston, the area of the 100 year floodplain varies by about 45% over a 18.6 year cycle (under current sea-level conditions; Enriquez et al., 2022).    We also developed methods for attribution of flooding to climate change and geomorphic change. The roles of geomorphic change and climate change on flooding were contrasted for New York Citys heavily urbanized Jamaica Bay, revealing that geomorphic change has had a similar influence as climate change driven sea level rise (Pareja-Roman et al. 2023). For most coastal sites, however, sea level rise is more impactful than geomorphic change (e.g. Strauss et al. 2021).   The project investigated how weather variability influences flood characteristics.
