<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by improving undergraduate engineering studentsâ€™ ability to communicate effectively through writing.  Undergraduate engineering students need more help to develop high-quality writing skills.  However, addressing this need is challenging due to limited time in engineering curricula and the limited emphasis engineering faculty members place on writing.  In addition, many engineering students devalue writing skills and underestimate the amount of writing needed to be successful in engineering careers. This project intends to improve engineering student writing in their specific disciplines through distribution and testing of a previously developed process for training peer STEM writing tutors. This process involves a partnership between the supervisor of writing center tutors and the STEM instructor. Together, they design a one-hour training experience during which writing tutors learn about the STEM assignment content, vocabulary, and expectations.  With this knowledge, the tutors can better support students during tutoring sessions to improve their specific writing assignment. This project will undertake a multi-institutional study to identify the elements of the tutor training process that have the most impact and the extent to which the process can be used to increase collaboration between engineering instructors and campus writing centers. It is expected that the training will lead to improvements in both tutoring effectiveness and student attitudes toward writing, ultimately supporting improvements in the writing skills of undergraduate engineering students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes a collaboration between Penn State Behrend, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, Indiana University Purdue University Columbus, and the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, a minority-serving institution.  Evaluation of the Writing Assignment Tutor Training process on these campuses will include examination of impacts on students, peer tutors, engineering instructors, writing centers, and writing tutor supervisors. Data collection methods will include pre- and post-training surveys, interviews, and focus groups. In addition, student writing samples from pre-and post-tutoring will be investigated. The investigators will analyze these data and use the results to guide development of a replicable, sustainable model for future expansion of the Writing Assignment Tutor Training approach to other institutions and STEM fields. This approach may serve as a model for other institutions to capitalize on existing infrastructure and resources, such as writing centers and peer tutors, to achieve large-scale improvements to undergraduate STEM writing while increasing collaboration between STEM and other disciplines. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The purpose of this project was to research a new approach for improving the writing of undergraduate students in STEM fields to help prepare them for success in their professional careers. The method was developed collaboratively by an engineering instructor and peer writing tutor supervisor who created an assignment-focused, one-hour training for experienced peer writing tutors without technical backgrounds.   This method, entitled Writing Assignment Tutor Training in STEM (WATTS), was expanded to two additional institutions across four campuses. During the three years of the grant, WATTS was implemented in eight courses, repeated over multiple semesters, by ten instructors. Writing was assessed with a modified version of the AAC&U Written Communication VALUE Rubric. Reports that were not reviewed by a tutor provided a baseline. There were no variations in baseline rubric scores across institutions, indicating that location is not a mitigating factor.   Students submitted reports for review by tutors who were either not WATTS-trained (control) or were WATTS-trained (experimental). Reports were assessed before meeting with the tutors and upon final submission after the students had the opportunity to implement suggested revisions. Assessment of reports from the control group showed varying levels of statistical significance in writing improvement. However, all rubric criteria yielded a statistically significant improvement in the experimental group, indicating that while any tutoring is beneficial, WATTS-trained tutors had a stronger and more consistent impact on writing outcomes.   In addition to assessing writing, all stakeholdersinstructors, tutor supervisors, students and tutorscompleted surveys regarding the impact of implementing WATTS. The survey results revealed auxiliary benefits that showed increases in the following: tutor self-efficacy, collaboration between students and tutors, collaboration between STEM programs and writing centers, and the use of writing centers overall.   There are a number of elements that make WATTS highly suitable for broad dissemination. First, the training capitalizes on existing writing center resources, which it further develops by strengthening the capabilities of undergraduate peer writing tutors, who are relatively low cost. This obviates the need for hiring dedicated, discipline-specific writing faculty or graduate students. Second, it relieves instructors of the need to comment on writing in student reports, which some instructors may not feel qualified to do. Also, improved student writing makes grading reports easier. Third, the time investment for instructors is small, since the training itself only takes one hour and focuses on instructor expectations of the tutors. Preparation for the training involves aggregating materials that have already been prepared for the course. Fourth, since the tutors are already trained and experienced, tutor supervisors require little preparation. They employ knowledge transfer principles to bridge their tutors prior experiences to the technical document. Finally, tutoring gives students an opportunity to explain their reports to a general audience (the tutors) which will likely be necessary in the workplace.   A dissemination approach developed by Supplemental Instruction (SI) that is self-perpetuating and has proven to be highly successful (in its 50th year) is a good model for WATTS. Both employ undergraduate peers to deliver their programming to students. And both train the program implementers to become certified trainers themselves to disseminate the program internally and beyond their institutions. The intention of WATTS is to mimic the SI approach of offering training onsite and online.   All the above factors suggest that the overall aim of WATTS, to improve STEM student writing, can be achieved and widely implemented incrementally and economically, enabling it to be a self-sustaining solution with the potential for ongoing future growth.
