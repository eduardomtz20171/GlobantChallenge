<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[A universal quantum simulator needs unlimited access to a so-called universal set of gates.  Universal gates, however, are expensive and noisy and therefore a resource that must be used sparingly with current technology. Understanding how starting from economical designs one can achieve more universal quantum simulators with sparse resources is of fundamental importance in both the construction of realistic quantum computers and in the theoretical understanding of quantum complexity, quantum chaos, and even black hole physics. Advancing our understanding of quantum simulators and quantum computers is one of the main goals of the country's current endeavor in both fundamental and applied science. Being at the forefront of the upcoming quantum information industrial revolution will bring enormous benefits for the economy, in particular creating new opportunities for people from disadvantageous backgrounds and provide an impulse for the advancement of scientific education at all levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How universal a quantum circuit is can be captured by how well it reproduces some average properties of quantum evolutions. In this project the group aims at studying how by doping circuits made of non-universal Clifford gates by means of non-Clifford gates one can drive transitions in quantum complexity and achieve a more universal coverage of the ensemble of quantum circuits.  They study the transitions in quantum complexity by entanglement complexity, out-of-time-order correlation functions, unitary t-designs, and the behavior of such circuits under an entanglement cooling protocol. Moreover, they plan to apply techniques of machine learning by a deep neural network to both detect the transitions in quantum complexity and to optimize the circuit architecture given the density of non-Clifford gates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Almost since its very inception, quantum mechanics (qm) elicited the question as to what made it so special. Later, it was realized that qm was way more complex than classical physics and that classical simulations of it were unsatisfactory. As R. Feynman pointed out in a famous speech:   Nature isnt classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, youd better make it quantum mechanical.   Indeed, quantum computers that are capable of universal quantum computation have an advantage over classical computers. This universality is reflected in the enormously greater complexity of quantum systems compared to classical ones. However, not all quantum computers are universal: some quantum computers can even be effectively simulated on a classical computer. The question regarding what makes a quantum computer more powerful than a classical one has proven to be incredibly subtle, and after many decades after conceiving the concept of quantum computing, it is still an open question.   The main outcome of this project is a set of theoretical results establishing that such quantum advantage and quantum complexity arise from the conspiration of two different, purely quantum, characteristics: entanglement and the so-called non-stabilizerness.   Both properties have be shown to be of entropic nature and a unified theory of quantum complexity must explain what makes quantum probabilities non-trivial and difficult to simulate.   The main outcomes obtained during the conduct of this project were (a) to give a solid theoretical advance to the notions of quantum complexity and quantum advantage based on the resource theory of stabilizer entropies, (b) to exploit this understanding to gain knowledge about both fundamental physics and the construction of better quantum computers and quantum algorithms; and (c) give an experimental demonstration of the theoretical results; (d) demonstrate a decisive societal impact of quantum technologies in terms of outreach, education, workforce and entrepreneurial training.
