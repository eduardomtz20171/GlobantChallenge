<AbstractNarration>This project provides funds for meeting costs, childcare, and travel support for students, early-career faculty, and scientists to attend the Heavy Mineral Analysis in Solving Tectonic Problems workshop. The workshop will be held at the Department of Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences at the University of Iowa on November 21-24, 2020. This workshop is important to the community through providing an interactive venue to present focused, cutting-edge research. The workshop will present an opportunity for U.S.-based researchers interested in solving tectonic problems through provenance analysis to gain new skillsets that represent departures from, as well as complementing, traditional provenance approaches, such as detrital zircon geochronology. Workshop themes will include the effects of source rock lithologies, climate, hydraulic sorting, weathering, and lithification on detrital signatures, and future directions of research in this field. The workshop will provide opportunities to discuss ideas and build networks in symposia and during laboratory time in afternoons, and opportunities for interactions during and after conference hours. The workshop will foster development of new research directions in solving tectonic problems through provenance analysis and will contribute to the development of a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce. Workshop participants will receive funding based on criteria such as membership of underrepresented groups, financial need, diversity of type of institutions, and geographic distribution. Conference organizers will submit a conference report to AGUâ€™s EOS publication and possibly also to GSA Today. The conference program will include topics of broad community relevance, which could be of benefit to society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Tectonics and Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology programs in the Division of Earth Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Sediments are geological archives; they faithfully record and preserve the signatures of ancient mountain building events, sea level fluctuations, and climate change. During transport and deposition of sediment, however, these signals are modified by physical and chemical processes both at the Earths surface and during their subsequent burial in the subsurface. Analysis of heavy (e.g., high density) minerals present in sediments has historically been one of most sensitive and widely used techniques to interpret and disentangle the factors influencing the composition of the sediment. Analysis of heavy minerals as a tool was established over 100 years ago and has recently seen a resurgence in both the application of the technique and further development of it by applying new technologies. Previous Heavy Mineral Schools for Earth science researchers have been offered by the University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy) in 2013, 2018, and 2020, but these international opportunities are financially restrictive for U.S.-based researchers, which can result in inequities in training of both students and professionals. In response to this need, the Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences at the University of Iowa hosted a workshop titledHeavy Mineral Analysis in Solving Tectonic ProblemsinNovember 2022. The goal of this workshop was to bring together a diverse group of international researchers focused on various aspects of heavy mineral analyses in order to expose U.S. researchers and students to new research and techniques that are being developed predominantly outside of the United States.   Successes of the workshop were five-fold: focused technical learning, a diverse audience, broadening networks of students and early career professionals, strengthening collaborations with co-conveners and attendees, andshrinking of the intellectual pond.
