<AbstractNarration>The project will develop new statistical methods to analyze stochastic phenomena that inherently evolves in time. The methods will be based on high-frequency monitoring of the phenomena under study, which is of widening use in many fields such as finance, meteorology, biology, neuroscience, turbulence, statistical physics, seismology, and telecommunication. Thus, the research will foster more interaction between applied scientists and statisticians. The research and educational elements of the project will also serve as a training tool for both undergraduate and graduate students by forming synergistic research groups involving all levels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonparametric methods are powerful statistical tools to reduce the model misspecification error, and high-frequency-based statistical analysis is a natural route to take when estimating the fine statistical features of continuous-time stochastic processes. Though the literature combining these two approaches has grown significantly during the last two decades, comparatively little work has been done to analyze and correct the sensitivity of methods to tuning parameters. The project will address these needs by (i) developing a unified approach for optimal kernel estimation of the spot volatility of an Ito process in the presence of leverage and microstructure noise; (ii) devising of optimal jump detection and integrated variance estimation methods, under the presence of stochastic volatility and infinite jump activity, via thresholding or shrinkage of the process' increments or wavelet coefficients; (iii) establishing theoretical guarantees for the data-driven plugging implementation methods resulting from the optimal schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The three general primary directions of the grant are the following:   (R1) Developing a unified approach for optimal kernel estimation of the spot volatility of an Ito process in the presence of leverage and microstructure noise;   (R2) Devising optimal jump detection and integrated variance estimation methods, under the presence of stochastic volatility and infinite jump activity, via thresholding or shrinkage of the process' increments or wavelet coefficients;   (R3) Establishing theoretical guarantees for the data-driven plugging implementation methods resulting from the proposed optimal schemes.   The following are some proposed educational activities of the project:   (E1) Research experiences for undergraduates and master's students;   (E2) Organization of special sessions in international and national conferences.      Summary of Activities:   (1) During the last year, one of the PI's Ph.D. students (Chang Liu) successfully defended his Ph.D. disseration in December 2023. The PI is currently working with two Ph.D. students: Jincheng Pang and Tianwei Zhou.   (2) I directed the undergraduate research of two students: Anna Wang and Thomas Li. Anna will pursue a graduate master program in MIT starting Fall and Thomas will continue during Summer 2024 in his research project.   (3) We submitted three papers:   (3a) Market Making with Stochastic Liquidity Demand: Simultaneous Order Arrival and Price Change Forecasts (jointly with Chuyi Yu and Agostino Capponi), submitted to SIAM journal of Financial Mathematics (SIFIN);   (3b) Efficient Integrated Volatility Estimation in the Presence of Infinite Variation Jumps via Debiased Truncated Realized Variations (jointly with Yuchen Han and Cooper Boniece), submitted to Stochastic Processes and their Applications (SPA);   (3c) Data-driven fixed-point tuning for truncated realized variations(jointly with Yuchen Han and Cooper Boniece), submittedto Bernoulli.   We received feedback from the three papers, requesting minor/major revisions. The SIFIN paper' revision was submitted and we are finishing the revision of the SPA paper. I will then start revisiing the Bernoulli paper.   (4) The PI organized a mininsymposium in the 2023 SIAM Conference on Financial Mathematics & Engineering, entitled "Inference and Calibration of Financial Models based on High-Frequency and LOB Data". The mini-symposium is strongly connected to the project.   (5) The PI is teaching a course in "Nonparametric Function Estimation" in Spring 2024, which is closely related to the project.      Significant Results:       (1) Related to the direction (R1), the PI proposed a spot volatility estimator based on kernel smoothing that is robust against microstructure noise, which is present in high- frequency data. The asymptotic was developed. One of the most important results is to show that the optimal kernel is the exponential kernel, which, on one hand, sheds some evidence against the use of uniform kernels and, on the other, motivates the study of kernels of unbounded support.   (2) Related to the direction (R2), the PI developed a new estimator for integrated volatility, which is variance and rate-efficient in the presence of infinite jump activity components. This is just the second estimator of this type and Monte Carlo experiments show the proposed estimator exhibits superior performance over the other method.      Contributions to Broad Impact:   (1)The researcher's findings are important to gauge the statistical and quantitative implications of sudden shifts (aka jumps) in continuous-time stochastic processes such as stock prices and other financial measurements. The proposed probabilistic models are aimed at providing a better description of real stock prices by incorporating jumps (such as crashes). An empirical assessment of the possible jumps of the underlying assets is critical as these shifts play a key role in implementing appropriate risk management and investment strategies. Furthermore, the incorporation of high-frequency intraday data is crucial, since the developed methods should take into account both the macro- and micro-empirical behavior of asset price.   (2) The main motivation of the project comes from applications in finance, so, the results are expected to be of interest to the financial and econometric community. The studied method may also be translated to other nonparametric methods in statistics.   (3) The PI is committed to educating and exposing graduate and undergraduate students to statistical and computational problems in real applications such as those encountered in the financial industry. He is currently advising 3 Ph.D. students at WashU.               Last Modified: 03/30/2024       Submitted by: JoseFigueroa-Lopez]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
