<AbstractNarration>Myelin is a specialized membrane that acts as an insulator for axons (the connecting structure of nerve cells) and that allows the nerve signals to be transmitted quickly throughout the body.  Despite the importance of this membrane to healthy nerve function, little is known about the structural dynamics or the interactions between the various molecules in the membrane.  Improving this understanding will open up new strategies to better understand myelin-related diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, and potentially engineer ways to repair or replace damaged myelin.  In addition to this societal impact, the research team will host an art show themed around nano-patterns and nano-structures related to myelin membranes as well as disseminate the knowledge through new graduate-level courses and to the broader public through connections established with Akron-area high school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is hypothesized that relatively subtle changes in the composition of myelin lipids or proteins can significantly alter the phase behavior of the myelin system and the formation dynamics of lipid domains.  These changes, in turn, lead to larger changes in membrane adhesion, rigidity, and integrity that can cause the myelin sheath to unravel and become dysfunctional.  This hypothesis will be tested with advanced surface science techniques, including a surface force apparatus, a Langumuir trough coupled with fluorescence microscopy, and a streaming potential apparatus.  The research will significantly advance the mechanistic understanding of how the lipids and proteins in the myelin membrane interact to affect the organization, fluidity, and rigidity of the myelin sheath.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
