<AbstractNarration>Freeze casting is a low-cost manufacturing technique for creating porous materials or foams. This award investigates freeze casting as a means to make iron-nickel, iron-cobalt, and iron-copper foams that help power batteries for storing energy on the electricity grid, or improve chemical looping technologies for capturing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. By advancing the materials manufacturing for these applications, this project contributes to national energy security, climate action goals, and U.S. competitiveness in the advanced energy materials sector. The knowledge developed in freeze casting of porous materials also benefits other industrial sectors such as healthcare, via porous bone-replacement implants, and automotive and aerospace, via lightweight structures. One current limitation to using freeze-cast energy materials is that they degrade during use. To address this problem, this research investigates methods, such as adding an alloying element, to stabilize freeze-cast iron foams and increase their usable lifetime. The relationships between manufacturing parameters and materials performance lay the groundwork for optimization and commercialization of such freeze-cast alloys. This project actively promotes participation of women and underrepresented minorities in research and continues building interdisciplinary and international collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In energy applications, such as high-temperature solid-oxide batteries or chemical looping combustion, iron-based redox materials rapidly degrade due to the repeated molar volume changes associated with oxidation/reduction reactions. The pore architecture of freeze-cast, lamellar foams is ideally suited to address this issue, as it provides space for each lamella to expand and contract freely, without constraints from neighboring lamellae. Nevertheless, mechanical degradation still occurs due to Kirkendall micropore formation from imbalanced diffusion fluxes and fracture/spallation of the oxide phase. Alloying iron foams with nickel, cobalt, or copper is investigated as a strategy to suppress the above degradation processes, by creating Ni-, Co- or Cu-rich ductile cores within the lamellae, and by making diffusional fluxes more balanced. In-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction and nano-tomography are used to reveal the phase and microstructural evolution in these alloys during redox cycling. These in-situ studies are complemented by thermogravimetry, ex-situ redox cycling, and metallography studies. Lastly, CALPHAD, phase-field, and finite-element models are developed to help guide alloy and composition selection, with validation provided by experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Because of its low cost and chemical versatility, Fe and Fe oxides have been intriguing as energy storage material for decades. One family of technologies that seek to utilize Fe are chemical-looping applications. These technologies put the reactive material through a series of alternating oxidation and reduction reactions to achieve a chemical or thermal goal. For instance, metallic Fe can be oxidized with steam to produce hydrogen on demand eliminating the need for costly hydrogen storage and transportation. Once fully oxidized, the solid Fe oxides can be easily transported to areas where hydrogen is produced, where they are reduced by hydrogen back to metallic Fe, and ready for another cycle. Similar paradigms exist for a number of chemicals, including converting CO2 into CO, producing heat from Fe oxidation, or even acting as a battery by pairing with a fuel cell. All these technologies have, however, been hindered by the poor cycle lifetime of unmodified Fe, which lasts only a few cycles before the reactions are so slow as to be unpractical due to strong sintering during high-temperature redox cycling. In this project, we developed our understanding of why this degradation occurs, and investigated many pathways to mitigating the degradation, ultimately discovering compositions that remain low cost but push the cycle lifetime into the hundreds. Our discoveries open the door for energy storage technologies based on Fe redox cycling, technologies that have been hindered for years by the short cycle lifetimes of Fe under these conditions.   The most impactful discovery of this project has been mapping the behavior of Fe-W mixtures undergoing redox cycling with steam and hydrogen at 800 C. We identified a compositional window for designing Fe-W foams with high degradation resistance, enabling Fe-W foams for long-term redox cycling for energy storage. Both Fe-18W and Fe-25W (at%) foams display rare microstructural robustness that enables extremely long cycle lifetimes, and increasingly fast cycling kinetics with additional cycles. Both these qualities stem from the reduction mechanism of FeWO4 by H2, a vapor-phase transition that serves to break apart sintered regions and redistribute them each and every cycle, effectively resetting the microstructure just by operating. Similar behavior was observed for Fe-25Mo foams, as well as ternary compositions like Fe-20Ni-20W. Further decrease W concentration reduces microstructural robustness as the observation of Fe segregation and core-shell structure formation in Fe-10W foams.   Other compositions were studied as well, in particular alloys of Fe with Co, Cu and Ni, elements defined by their lack of reaction with steam at 800 C. Though these three elements have this property in common, their behavior when alloyed with Fe varies significantly. Co and Ni are soluble in Fe, and result in the formation of a metallic backbone that remains in place even when the Fe is oxidized. This helps maintain the foam structure as compared to pure Fe, but ultimately degrades due to the same mechanisms within 50 cycles. Co and Ni also help accelerated reduction, but slow oxidation. Cu is insoluble in Fe, and though Cu helps accelerate both oxidation and reduction initially, the incompatibility of Cu and Fe results in faster degradation than in pure Fe.   In addition to tinkering with the chemistry of the material, we also investigated how the shape of the foam affects the cycling behavior. We examined freeze cast foams, 3-D ink-printed microlattices, and simple powder beds, finding that the morphology has a strong effect on the cycling behavior, but that ultimately the chemical composition must be robust to continue cycling for long periods regardless of the architecture. The best architectures are those that enable hierarchical porosity, with larger pores that can remain open even if the microstructure is unstable, to prevent the formation of a dense outer shell that limits further reactivity.   In addition to technical discoveries with scientific relevance, this project provided an opportunity for professional development and collaboration, with 3 undergraduates, 1 masters student, 1 doctoral student, and 1 postdoctoral scholar contributing over the course of the project. The beautiful images of the microstructure and freeze cast architecture blurred the line between art and science (see micrograph "Breaking through the crust" which received an Honorable Mention in the 2023 'Art of Science' Image Contest at the NUANCE Center); also, the freeze casting process inspired a collaboration with a computer science undergraduate student to develop a publicly available freeze-casting video game. Finally, we are planning to launch a start-up company based on this technology, which will contribute to the Chicago work force development.
