<AbstractNarration>The Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas at Austin (UTEX) is one of only a handful of curated, public, biodiversity collections of living algae. UTEX is a repository and distribution center for algal biodiversity. The UTEX Collection is of the most genetically diverse assemblages of organisms available to the public and many of the algae UTEX maintains are unique and irreplaceable. Every year UTEX distributes thousands of living algal cultures, at modest cost, to scientists, educators, and students throughout the U.S. and the world. The great interest in microscopic algae as sources of transportation fuel, human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, and many other uses makes UTEX algae and services essential resources for hundreds of research projects. UTEX provides hands-on workshops on managing algal cultures, an informative interactive web site, species identification services, chemical composition analysis, and extensive correspondence with students engaged in algal research. UTEX personnel give presentations at public schools, conduct tours of UTEX facilities, assist teachers and students in conducting high school science projects, and provide presentations on the scientific importance of algae to hundreds of children every year at local open house events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UTEX currently maintains more than 3,000 unique living algal strains representing all major taxa, including over 450 type species. The UTEX mission is to promote, support, and enable the use of algae for research, education, and practical applications. In order to fulfill its mission, UTEX provides living algae to a user community at modest cost; serves as a permanent public repository of newly discovered and recently described algal species of potential value representing a broad range of genetic, morphological and biochemical diversity; acts as a source of information regarding algae to practicing scientists, other professionals, and the interested public; promotes and supports local science teaching and hands-on scientific activities by school children; and provides practical training services, support services, and supplies that facilitate culturing of algae at other sites. UTEX provides living algae starter cultures, bulk cultures, growth media, photobioreactors, photometers, genomic DNA and digital images.  Services include identification of algae by morphological and DNA-sequence methods, physiological and biochemical characterization of algae, and cryogenetic storage of proprietary strains. UTEX maintains active research on cryopreservation technology, biochemical characterization, genomic sequencing, and taxonomic identification of accessioned strains. Algae-based research within the local institution is actively supported through the provision of cultures and by consultation with UTEX staff. Every year hundreds of published research articles reference the use of UTEX strains, many of which also recognize NSF support. In addition, many UTEX strains are used in research leading to the development of microalgae-based technologies for the production of biofuels and many other products. A comprehensive web site (www.utex.org) facilitates a secure means for ordering goods and services, provides links to resources elsewhere pertaining to algae, and includes diverse algae-related information.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Along with plants, they are responsible for nearly all primary production on earth. Algae are critical to the sustainability of life as we know it and are of considerable and growing economic importance. Algae are widely used in basic research and education and are also heavily utilized for applied research and technology development. Algae have enormous potential for the development of renewable fuels, as sustainable sources of food for humans, livestock and fish, for pharmaceutical discovery, as engines to drive carbon sequestration, and for many other applications that will benefit humanity moving forward in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p> <p>The Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Texas at Austin (UTEX) is a curated public collection that serves as a permanent, living repository of algal biodiversity. It makes an essential contribution to the continuity and reproducibility of algae-related research by preserving the uniformity and stability of algal strains and related materials. UTEX maintains one the most diverse collections of algae in the world and is internationally recognized as a valuable source for living algae, algae-related materials, and for information pertaining to microalgae culturing. Over the last three years, NSF support enabled UTEX to secure the diversity of the algal strains it maintains by streamlining operating procedures and expanding its storage capacity for maintaining cryogenic stocks. NSF support also enabled UTEX to provide support for hundreds of research projects throughout the U.S. During this time, more than 10,000 orders of living algae and related materials were distributed, at modest cost, to academic scientists, high school and college students, national laboratory researchers, and to those working to develop algae for commercial purposes. UTEX algae have been cited in nearly 5,000 scholarly journal articles and patent applications over the last three years.</p> <p>Outreach and education are central to the UTEX mission. UTEX personnel collectively spend an average of 30-40 hrs./week assisting students and professionals who wish to learn to culture algae through personal dialog, telephone conversations, e-mail correspondence, and social media outlets (Facebook, X, Instagram, and&nbsp;LinkedIn). UTEX maintains an extensive, regularly updated, public web site (<a href="https://utex.org/">https://utex.org/</a>) that contains UTEX strain data and information on algal culturing methods. UTEX provides and participates in many different local and national service activities. UTEX provides algae-related materials, training, and living cultures to undergraduate students involved in educational projects such as the UT-Austin Freshman Research Initiative (FRI), the International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM), and the Algae Academy. UTEX employs 5-10 undergraduate research assistants to work in the Collection every semester, with financial need as a major factor in hiring. These students become well-trained laboratory microbiologists during their time at UTEX, providing them with work experience and professional job skills. UTEX supports local science-fair projects through consultation and the provision of cultures for local projects and by allowing students to visit and learn how to culture algae. The UTEX website provides suggestions for science projects, and teaching kits are supplied for teacher and student use. UTEX hosts graduate students and Ph.D.-level professionals every year who come for extended periods of time to learn how to manage algal cultures. In addition to these NSF-supported service activities, UTEX personnel conduct research projects in the areas of large-scale cultivation, cryopreservation, biochemical composition, algal toxin production and detection, wastewater remediation, molecular genetics, and comparative genomics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 07/23/2024<br> Modified by: David&nbsp;R&nbsp;Nobles</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2015674/2015674_10723092_1721326158785_Agar_Cultures--rgov-214x142.JPG" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2015674/2015674_10723092_1721326158785_Agar_Cultures--rgov-800width.JPG" title="Agar Cultures"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2015674/2015674_10723092_1721326158785_Agar_Cultures--rgov-66x44.JPG" alt="Agar Cultures"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">�TEX maintains and distributes more than 3,000 distinct strains of algae to researchers and educators all over the world.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephen Pe�a</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;R&nbsp;Nobles <div class="imageTitle">Agar Cultures</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2015674/2015674_10723092_1721323243263_IMG_0030--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2015674/2015674_10723092_1721323243263_IMG_0030--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student Training: Microbiology"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2015674/2015674_10723092_1721323243263_IMG_0030--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student Training: Microbiology"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">UTEX undergraduate students receive extensive training in microbiological techniques.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephen Pe�a</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">David&nbsp;R&nbsp;Nobles <div class="imageTitle">Student Training: Microbiology</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2015674/2015674_10723092_1721325803488_IMG_0015_edited--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2015674/2015674_10723092_1721325803488_IMG_0015_edited--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Barcoding"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2015674/2015674_10723092_1721325803488_IMG_0015_edited--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Barcoding"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">UTEX developed a dedicated barcoding system to track cryogenic stocks and automatically update any changes in our database.
