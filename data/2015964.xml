<AbstractNarration>This award will advance our fundamental understanding of how cells sense and react to diverse mechanical inputs from their environments. Cells utilize local environmental cues from the extracellular matrix (ECM), adhesive molecules, and local stiffness to make decisions about growth and movement. The process of converting mechanical stimulus to electrical energy at the ECM is commonly thought to act via adhesion proteins such as integrins. Emerging research on Piezo ion channels reveals that these channels can also respond to changes in the substrate mechanical properties. Therefore, these channels may serve as additional force sensors. This work will explore the role of a novel cell sensor, called Piezo1, in detecting ECM forces. The results may ultimately impact on human health. For example, the bodyâ€™s mishandling of these mechanical signals results in a variety of diseases, including chronic kidney disease and cancer. The results of this work may lead to new types of treatment for these conditions.  The outcome has the potential to be broadly applicable, since Piezo1 is found in many cell types and organs where the mechanical environment plays a major role in proper function. The research findings will be integrated into outreach activities through an Education through Experimentation (E2E) platform that involves graduate, undergraduate, and local high school students in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is based on the hypothesis that Piezo1 is the primary force sensor in epithelial cells, and that it detects the substrate mechanical cues translated into membrane tension. This occurs through a feedforward mechanism: local tension activates Piezo1 channels and calcium influx, which stimulates calcium-dependent contractility and cell spreading; the changes in cell geometry in turn, promote more Piezo1 activity and the migration of Piezo1 to regions under stress, causing further growth in the same direction. This hypothesis will be tested with substrate modulation as mechanical stimulus, a FRET-based fluorescent probe to report opening transitions in Piezo1, and a wound healing assay to screen cell mobility. There are three primary objectives. First, to identify ECM force sensors in cells by inhibiting Piezo1 activity and by knockdown of Piezo1. Second, to investigate how substrates alter Piezo1 responsiveness by visualizing the location and opening of channels during cell reshaping. Third, to test the hypothesis that functional Piezo1 expression level determines the identity of leader cells guiding collective cell migration. Taken together, the results of this work have the potential to transform our understanding of the mechanisms of various disease states that affect epithelial cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This process is commonly thought to be mediated via adhesion proteins such as integrins at the adhesion complex. Research in this project reveals that Piezo channels can detect and respond to changes in substrate mechanical properties, indicating that there exists additional force sensing apparatus in the cells. The study further investigated the force coupling mechanisms and demonstrated that Piezo1 channels couple with actin cytoskeleton to transmit the ECM forces to the cell nucleus and cell membrane. This result provides new insights into molecular mechanisms of cells sensing and transduction of local environmental cues.   The significant outcomes are as follows.   1) This study reveals that Piezo1 functions are required for cell remodeling on micropatterns, and that Piezo1 is a primary ECM force sensor. It demonstrates for the first time that Piezo1 has at least two roles in cell expansion on the patterned substrates. First, they open to create a Ca2+ influx that activates Ca2+-dependent contraction forces, enabling focal adhesion maturation and cell expansion. Second, inhibiting channel conductance produces different results than a knockout so that Piezo1 also has effects beyond its role as an ion channel.   2) Research shows that Piezo1 sensing function is achieved via Ca2+ dependent actin stress fiber polymerization in epithelial cells. The coupling of Piezo1 and actin cytoskeleton provides a sensing and transmitting apparatus for substrate mechanical inputs.   3) Research is further extended to the force transduction mechanisms from the substrate to the nucleus. Results show that the nuclear shape and orientation can be modulated by the ECM forces. This process involves Piezo1 mediated Ca2+ signaling, that promotes the formation of peripheral actin stress fibers, altering nuclear shape. Thus, Piezo1 channels also act as force sensors for the nuclei.
