<AbstractNarration>The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) operates R/V Sikuliaq, a 261-foot, global class ice-capable oceanographic research vessel owned by the NSF as part of the Academic Research Fleet (ARF) fleet. Sikuliaq provides a general-purpose platform for multidisciplinary research missions from polar to temperate latitudes. The ship was delivered in 2014 and has completed five years of funded operations. UAF requests funds to purchase and install Oceanographic Instrumentation that would be custom engineered to enhance the vessel's capability in support of NSF-sponsored research to be undertaken on Sikuliaq in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2019, Sikuliaq completed 274 days, 183 (68%) of which were for NSF. In 2020, the vessel is scheduled to sail 248 days with 163 days of the schedule for NSF.  With this proposal, UAF provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Ship-Side Software-Defined Data Center  $317,800 &lt;br/&gt;2) Ship-Side Core Network Refresh $50,000 &lt;br/&gt;3) Ship-Side Access Layer Refresh  $250,000 &lt;br/&gt;4) Ship-Side Backup Storage $31,000 &lt;br/&gt;5) Shore-Side Software-Defined Data Center  $100,000 &lt;br/&gt;6) Ship-Side Wireless Refresh $82,500 &lt;br/&gt;7) Ship-Side Routing Refresh $7,500 &lt;br/&gt;       $838,800 &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The primary objectives of the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) R/V Sikuliaq proposal and NSF award number 2016850 were to completely overhaul the Cyber Infrastructure of the vessel. A new VMWare vCenter cluster consisting of three HP DL325 G10 host servers plus a Fujitsu SAN with 110TB of usable storage were installed in August, 2020. In addition, the full network backbone was replaced with new 10 Gigabit-capable network switches as well as state of the art Wireless access points throughout the vessel. This project strategically focused on changing existing storage and virtualization from Network Attached Storage (NAS) and open source VirtualBox solutions toward an enterprise grade industry standard Storage Area Network (SAN) and VMWare Cluster. The primary intent and motivation for this direction was to converge on a CI solution which would be compatible with those being used in the U.S. Academic Research Fleet by the University of California San Diego / SCRIPPS, Oregon State University / RCRV, and University of Washington. With a goal of realizing a future potential fleetwide cyberinfrastructure service.  Sikuliaq's IT and technicalstaff have become well-versed in virtualization technologies and are able to easily provide support to the variety of scientific objectives that the vessel regularly undertakes.
