<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New materials are driving advances that will revolutionize many areas ranging from standard to quantum computing.  One type of material of particular interest are unconventional superconductors.  These materials, which are often described as strongly correlated electronic systems,  have several novel properties in both their normal and superconducting state that make them a desirable platform for new applications.  Such correlations can make the electrons exhibit novel effects such as chirality i.e. handedness and nematicity or orientational order.  These novel electronic effects can be exploited in new quantum technologies for computing and secure communication. Mastering the control of different quantum phases is an integral part in the development of such high pay-off new technologies. This research will use velocity of sound measurements in high magnetic fields and with the application of uniaxial pressure to locate the various magnetic phases and study how they evolve. The project will also support the involvement of students in research as well as outreach activities to local schools and museums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is for experimental work in very high magnetic fields and high pressures, applied uniaxially, on the heavy electron system UPt3.  This is a unique metal which exhibits multiple phases in its superconducting (SC) as well in the normal magnetic states.  In UPt3 a minute trigonal distortion, i.e. a departure from its nominal hexagonal crystal symmetry is known to exist.  Such symmetry breaking effects are quite general in many families of strongly correlated electronic systems (SCES).  Multiple states such as charge (CDW) and spin (SDW) density waves, unconventional superconductivity and novel magnetic phases can coexist in SCES and precisely controlled experiments are needed to tease out the various physical interactions. Through a combined application of high magnetic fields and large uniaxial stress  the PI proposes to delicately tune the broken crystal symmetry in UPt3.  Such a conjoint application of two very large external fields, magnetic and pressure, has hitherto never been employed and hence the proposed work is risky.  The different magnetic phases and how they evolve under simultaneous application of high magnetic fields and high pressure will be studied by measuring the velocity of ultrasound passing through crystals of UPt3.  Sound velocity is a very sensitive measure of how electrons in the different magnetic and SC phases behave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  There are a wide variety of emerging electronic materials being researched today. Of these superconductors form a class of materials on their own. It has been believed for a long time that superconductors and magentic materials are the antitheses of each other. However, in recent decades it has become clear that in ceratin materials which we term as "strongly correlated systems" superconductivity, a state of zero resistance to electrical conduction, can arise starting from a system which is an insulator, i.e. that does not allow electrons to move at all. Thus, in this sense, a strongly correlated "insulator" is a more fundamental state of matter and therefore merits more of an attention than a strongly correlated superconductor. Thus in this project a decision was made to focus on emerging insulating quantum materials.   One such new class of insulating materials are those that are predcited to harbor "quantum spin liquid" states. A quantum spin liquid is very much like a superconductor where all the spins in the solid sample are "entangled" much like electrons entangle in a superconductor in pairs - a phenomenon that is well accepted. But the entangled properties of quantum spin liquid states is less known and the very existence of such spin liquid states is still not convincingly established. However, there are many tell-tale signs that such exotic quantum states such as spin liquids exist in many real materials.   In this project we focused our attention on two such emerging material systems: (a) one belonging to the family of spin systems termed Kitaev materials - due to their planar hexagonal arrangement of spins - originally proposed by Kitaev and (b) two - another belonging to the kagome lattice family - kagome here referring to the Japanese basket waving pattern that is mimicked in the arrangement of spins in these materials.   In both these classes of materials, Kitaev and kagome, we discovered unexpected and unusual responses of the alignment of spins when an external magnetic field is applied. It was discovered that contrary to ordinary magnets where the number of spins align with the magnetic field linearly proportional to the field here we found that the spins align in a super-linear fashion. We also found that in the Kitaev case this behavior is highly anisotropic as might be expected due to the layered nature of the spin arrangement.   Furthermore, in order to interpret and understand our experimental results we developed theoretical models in collaboration with colleagues and these fairly succesfully reproduced our observations. These efforts thus lend confidence in the identification of the material systems we studied strong as candidates hosting quantum spin liquid states.   Besides our theoretical colleagues, coming from three separate institutions nationally, the project involved collaborations that strectched across the globe (China, Brazil, Germany and Japan), participation of national labs, and most importantly undergraduate students (majority of them female) and graduate students.
