<AbstractNarration>San Diego State University and the University of California San Diego have partnered to improve mentorship, sponsorship, networking, and institutional and disciplinary leadership capacity for women and other underrepresented minority faculty in STEM. Our Multi-Campus Transformation and Equity Network (MCTEN) will focus on transformative interventions that create and elevate a robust cross-campus network of faculty who will cement existing change, catalyze new efforts, and establish southern California as a regional center for diversity, inclusion and excellence in STEM. Adopting small group, network and community-building approaches, with a specific focus on intersectionality, MCTEN will create lasting intra and inter institutional connections to support meaningful and sustainable change in STEM fields, including sciences and engineering, and the academy. In San Diego, this regional transformation is critical in order to take full advantage of the innovation and research excellence from ethnically, racially and gender diverse faculty, and to adequately serve the students in the San Diego region who meet the critical STEM workforce needs of the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MCTEN will bring innovative applications of documented and effective ADVANCE interventions to a multi-campus, regional network, using insights about organizational change drawn from small-group theory. We will also draw from network science, using networking, network development, and mentoring to reduce negative impacts of the lived experiences of isolation and stress reported by women and URM faculty in STEM departments. This partnership, which brings together Californiaâ€™s university systems in a region with demographics that reflect national trends, will demonstrate how ADVANCE interventions across campuses in a region can support and empower URM women faculty and can provide conditions needed for all scholars to thrive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE "Partnership" awards provide support to collaborations among STEM professional societies and academic and non-academic non-profit organizations designed to broaden the implementation of evidence-based equity strategies and have a national or regional reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Multi-Campus Transformation Equity Network (MCTEN), a Partnership between San Diego State University (SDSU) and the University of California San Diego (UCSD), develped networks and supported better policy, in order to mitigate the isolation and stress reported by many STEM faculty and support inclusion and productivity.

Below we briefly describe major activities, with the goal(s) indicated.   Analyzing work-work conflict and work-family conflict at a Hispanic-serving (HSI) research university (Goal C)   PI Blair-Loy, graduate student Reynders, and Mitchneck, Baraki, Lewison and Crockett (SDSU) co-authored a peer-reviewed original research article, "Pandemic impacts, cultural conflicts and moral dilemmas among faculty at a Hispanic-serving research university," October 2023,Community, Work & Family,26:5, 626-649, DOI: 10.1080/13668803.2023.2271644.   "We conducted focus groups with STEM faculty at a case university with high expectations for researchandteaching and its federal designation as a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). Cultural schemas, which outline core content of professional culture, provide analytical lenses. In addition to the schemas of scientific research excellence and devotion identified previously, we find evidence of a cultural schema of radical connection and service to undergraduates, many of whom are Latinx and in families who face high risks from the pandemic. We argue that work-work conflict and work-family conflict are rooted in cultural schemas of the academic profession that clashed intensively during the pandemic. These clashes intensify moral dilemmas for faculty and reinforce inequalities . We urge the federal government to expand the expectations for HSI designation beyond achieving a demographic profile to equip campuses to fully serve their diverse student bodies and fully sustain the faculty and staff who support them."   Small Groups of early career STEM faculty plus mentors (GoalA)   We created small groups of early career faculty and mentors: SDSU's Action Collaboratives (68 junior faculty and 22 mentors) and UCSD's Junior Faculty Action Collaboratories (23 faculty and 5 mentors).They were designed to reduce stress and isolation on campus.   Writing Retreats (GoalsA and B)   On the San Diego Bay, we convened four 2-day writing retreats with faculty participants from both campuses. Retreats provided dedicated writing time and social time. 78% to 96% of participants reported that the retreats increased productivity, collaboration, and the sense of belonging.   Workshop onEvaluating Academic Excellence (Goals A and C)   The UCSD team, working with the Center for Faculty Diversity and Inclusion, developed and led a climate- and equity-enhancing, professional-development Workshopentitled"What is academic excellence? Examining department and university expectations through an equity-minded lens."Most departments on UCSD's main campus publish on the university website their department's Standards for advancement through tenure and beyond. Workshop Participants included approximately 15 faculty members who have emerged as leaders in promoting inclusive excellence on campus. The Workshop began with the PI's presentation of a translational summary of key social science literature and best practices. Participants then moved into small groups based on broad disciplinary affiliation, and they examined their own departments' Standards for advancement. Participants flagged elements in their Standards that were problematic (e.g., unclear or potentially vulnerable to a biased interpretation) and areas of excellence that were missing in the Standards (e.g., mentoring of underrepresented early career scholars) and planned to bring these ideas back to their departments for a potential revew and revision of Standards.   New policy for a better campus climate (Goal C)   An Anti-Pass-the-Harasser policy was implemented at SDSU that was modeled after a previously-established UC program and developed with collaborations we facilitated between SDSU and UCSD administrators. This policy requires that candidates short-listed for tenured faculty positions allow the release of any information from their institution about misconduct that may have occurred.   INTELLECTUAL MERIT: We used cultural schemas as an analytical lens to examine work-work and work-life conflict among STEM faculty.   BROADER IMPACTS: Our networking activities reduced stress and isolation and increased productivity and the sense of inclusion. We also supported policy for better climate on campus and more inclusive excellence in faculty advancement standards.
