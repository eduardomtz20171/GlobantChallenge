<AbstractNarration>San Diego State University and the University of California San Diego have partnered to improve mentorship, sponsorship, networking, and institutional and disciplinary leadership capacity for women and other underrepresented minority faculty in STEM. Our Multi-Campus Transformation and Equity Network (MCTEN) will focus on transformative interventions that create and elevate a robust cross-campus network of faculty who will cement existing change, catalyze new efforts, and establish southern California as a regional center for diversity, inclusion and excellence in STEM. Adopting small group, network and community-building approaches, with a specific focus on intersectionality, MCTEN will create lasting intra and inter institutional connections to support meaningful and sustainable change in STEM fields, including sciences and engineering, and the academy. In San Diego, this regional transformation is critical in order to take full advantage of the innovation and research excellence from ethnically, racially and gender diverse faculty, and to adequately serve the students in the San Diego region who meet the critical STEM workforce needs of the nation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MCTEN will bring innovative applications of documented and effective ADVANCE interventions to a multi-campus, regional network, using insights about organizational change drawn from small-group theory. We will also draw from network science, using networking, network development, and mentoring to reduce negative impacts of the lived experiences of isolation and stress reported by women and URM faculty in STEM departments. This partnership, which brings together Californiaâ€™s university systems in a region with demographics that reflect national trends, will demonstrate how ADVANCE interventions across campuses in a region can support and empower URM women faculty and can provide conditions needed for all scholars to thrive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE "Partnership" awards provide support to collaborations among STEM professional societies and academic and non-academic non-profit organizations designed to broaden the implementation of evidence-based equity strategies and have a national or regional reach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The three central objectives of the MCTEN ADVANCE Partnership grant were to: build community to reduce stress and isolation, catalyze and promote sustainable cultural change, support and highlight innovative policies. To achieve these objectives, MCTEN used small group theory to form intentional communities, established strong communities of practice, and work collaboratively with campus leaders to implement new policies.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p dir="ltr"><span>Our intentional communities centered around Action Collaboratives (ACs). ACs are intentional networks designed to increase a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of stress and isolation experienced particularly by women, women of color and other HMUF in STEM fields. ACs met monthly and paired early career STEM faculty across departments with complementary research interests with senior faculty sponsors. We used Ecological Momentary Assessments to measure how AC meetings influenced experiences of stress and isolation. MCTEN&rsquo;s community of practice was centered around activities that focused on scholarship&nbsp; and research activity, and strengthening the sense of belonging among faculty. These activities included creating spaces to support virtual weekly writing sessions (DWS), off-site writing retreats, and professional development lunches. Dedicated Writing Space (DWS) was launched in Year 1 of the project to support productivity and foster and build community among faculty. DWS offered MCTEN faculty an opportunity to join a virtual meeting space to work alongside other faculty. Each week, we convened four 1-hour blocks where participants had the opportunity to check in with each other at the beginning and end of the one-hour blocks and then work together in community. We also convened 8 writing retreats, two per year, providing additional support for dependent care, where faculty could work in community. Finally, we established Chew on This!, a monthly lunch and learn series that covered topics requested by the community and further strengthened connections among early-career and more senior faculty. Chew on This! topics included how to set up a lab, creating impactful graphics, developing impactful broader impacts, and interdisciplinary research conversations.
