<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to San Francisco State University (SFSU) to purchase an advanced Laser Point-Scanning Confocal Microscope system for research and research training of the diverse students (44% from historically under-represented (HU) groups, &gt;50% low income, 48% 1st generation college students, and 57% women) at this Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI). The new capabilities of this instrument, which will be housed in the Cell and Molecular Imaging Center at SFSU, will enable students to become experts in state-of-the-art technology, which is critical for success in highly competitive doctoral programs and the biotechnology industry. Students using the system will also be featured in Scientist Spotlights authored by SFSU HU undergraduates. These spotlights showcase scientists that do not conform to classic stereotypes and provide inspiring and relevant near-peer role models as well as examples of diverse, local scientists to engage K-12 students and the public in STEM. The advanced features of the system will also enable summer research training courses to be held at SFSU to broaden opportunities for more SFSU undergraduates to conduct research, a factor closely tied to degree completion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The confocal microscopy system will impact a broad, interdisciplinary range of research projects. Fifteen investigators from the Biology, Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, Physics, and Kinesiology Departments at SFSU will use the instrument to conduct studies in cell and developmental biology, physiology, and materials science. The instrument will enable tracking and quantification of changes in molecular features of cellular dynamics, including chromosome segregation in C. elegans, organelle inheritance and size regulation in yeast and Drosophila, and subcellular protein localization in bacteria, plant, and mammalian cells. Features of the instrument will enable detection of stimulus-induced changes in signaling molecules required for development in mammals as well as the analysis of a broad spectrum of low-level fluorescence in nanomaterials. The system will support SFSU researchers to conduct relevant and impactful research and disseminate their new discoveries in peer-reviewed journal articles and presentations at scientific conferences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Within the first year of installation of the system, 42 people were trained to use the instrument, including 36 students [17 (47%) identify as minorities under-represented in STEM].
