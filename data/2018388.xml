<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation, and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Montana State University is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with an automatic sampler to support Professors Michael Mock, Valerie Copie, Matthew Cook, and other colleagues. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as permitting study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution and nearby Tribal Colleges as well as the University of Montana and other small colleges across the state. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially facilitates studies of molecular catalysts for nitrogen reduction and ammonia oxidation of relevance to the production of fertilizers. The instrumentation is also used for monitoring cascade reactions and controlling site selectivity in cross-coupling reactions and activating inert hydrocarbons using early transition metals. In addition, it provides information to aid exploration of halogen bonding in supramolecular and self-assembly chemistry. The spectrometer is also used to study mechanisms in organic and organometallic chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
