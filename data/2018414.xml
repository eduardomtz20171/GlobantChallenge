<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs as well as the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). Kansas State University is acquiring a single crystal X-ray diffractometer to support Professor Christer Aakeroy and colleagues Duy Hua and Stefan Bossmann. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles.  A diffractometer also provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The research may impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry as well other departments at this institution. The science enabled by this instrument has the potential to impact society through the development of new materials to address environmental pollution and new catalysts to improve the synthesis of commodity and industrial chemicals. In addition, the instrumentation provides direct research experience to local students and serves as a resource to Kansas Wesleyan University and the University of Kansas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the X-ray diffractometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The science enabled by this instrument provides relevant societal benefits through the determination of structures of small molecules with biomedical implications and starting materials for the conversion of modifiable-metal-organic frameworks into biomimetic catalytically functional materials. The instrumentation is used to investigate chalcogen bonds and explore regiochemistry of carbon-hydrogen bond oxidation of acyclic alkanes. In addition, researchers benefit from the ability to examine small-molecule and nutrient and contaminant transformations in soil. The diffractometer is also used to understand molecular mechanisms of dye-decolorizing peroxidases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The award has provided invaluable infrastructure in support of research efforts involving eight different groups from Kansas State University (from three different Colleges), and one group at a nearby undergraduate college, Kansas Wesleyan. So far, more than a dozen peer-reviewed papers have been published, and more than two-dozen conference presentations have been given on work obtained by the new instrument. Data from this instrument has also been invaluable to the completion of four PhD theses, and another six doctoral degrees that use data from this instrument are in progress. The X-ray single-crystal diffractometer represents the foundation of a state-of-the-art facility for structural characterization of crystalline materials of interest to scientists spanning the range from chemical engineering to biomolecular chemistry. So for, more than 800 data sets have been collected, and more than 300 new crystal structures have been solved and refined. The research that has been supported includes work on developing inexpensive and sustainable catalysts for various chemical transformations. This work is motivated by a need to replace currently utilized catalysts based on platinum group metals, which are expensive, toxic, and of increasingly limited supply. Another research team has been able to control photophysical properties by modulating molecular assembly and structure, and structural data have been instrumental in elucidating the molecular structure of new vehicles for drug delivery. Overall, the data generated from this instruments is now the foundation for a valuable structural core-facility that has become a true multi-user 'hub' for researchers spanning fundamental science from natural product synthesis to materials science. In addition, the instrument has also provided a surprisingly useful focal point for departmental tours geared towards (i) recruiting both new graduate and undergraduate students and (ii) supporting outreach efforts aimed towards increasing minority participation in STEM disciplines and (iii) inspiring visitors from local High School students.
