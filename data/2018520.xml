<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) –an automated multi-functional instrument for electrical, magnetic, and optical measurements on semiconductors, superconductors, organic thin films, and low dimensional materials. This instrument supports rapidly expanding research activity in the field of nano-science, including 2D materials as well as flexible electronics and device engineering at Ohio University. Furthermore, the training and education afforded by this equipment has very significant societal implications and is expected to make significant contributions toward the development of a technically-educated workforce in the Appalachian corner of the State of Ohio.  The cross-cutting nature of this equipment reinforces research and education endeavors locally and fosters new research directions in several areas of basic science and applied nanotechnology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MRI award supports the acquisition of a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) – an open architecture and automated multi-functional instrument for electrical, magnetic, and optical measurements The broad spectrum of research projects directly impacted by the PPMS includes the growth and characterization of i) novel nanomaterials and composites, ii) established and emerging 2D materials and heterostructures, iii) printed and deposited thin films of polymers and composites, iv) magnetic nanoparticles, v) superconducting materials and structures, and vi) carbon-based composite materials. These projects sustain unique and advanced research programs in south-eastern Ohio by enabling the exploration of new materials and physical effects. By doing so, the projects make possible progress toward developing low-cost materials, with engineered properties, that could enable a range of novel device technologies critical to modern electronics and consumer applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
