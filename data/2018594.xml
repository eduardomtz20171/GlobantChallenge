<AbstractNarration>This instrument, a new high-performance computing (HPC) platform, aims to accelerate knowledge discovery by supporting the research of 32 investigators from 15 departments. Building upon an institutional focus on simulation- and data-driven science, it will enable significant advances in two types of research, foundational and translational, and support training and development.  Leveraging the HPC cluster, investigators in computer science, engineering, statistics, agriculture, and biology will conduct research on cyber-enabled systems design, thermal flows in the built environment, the design of materials, and phenotyping methods for plant and animal agriculture. This HPC cluster will enhance existing collaborative efforts and enable building new ones, support advanced student training in computational modeling and algorithm development, and allow sustained workforce development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This HPC system for Cyber-Enabled System Design includes a mix of computing nodes and nodes with general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs), with sufficient memory, disk storage and parallel input/output capability to support cutting-edge research. The instrument will enable: (a) foundational data science advances with a focus on algorithms for system design under uncertainty, for cyber-physical data assimilation, and analysis of complex flow and material systems, (b) translation research in three thematic areas: energy, materials and manufacturing, and precision agriculture, with a focus on “materials by design”, smart power grid, quieter aircraft and wind turbines, and precision animal science, and (c) HPC training for undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students, to prepare a globally engaged, HPC aware workforce.  Research using this computer system has the potential to improve food production, energy usage and manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The goals are to minimize the need for significantly large computation resources for training and fair evaluation of various search methods. NAS Benchmarks can provide critical insights and a deeper understanding of the design process. The benchmarking process lays the groundwork for future advancements in this area.</p> <p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p> <p><em>Multigrid Distributed Deep CNNs Solvers</em>. We develop deep learning (DL)-based methods on high-resolution 3D geometries to predict the optimized topology. We use a multi-resolution CNN approach, where we train the network at a lower resolution in a distributed manner and then transfer the learned network to continue training at a higher resolution. Our scalable framework integrates two distinct advances, accelerating training a large model and implementing a distributed deep learning framework which significantly reduces the training time.

We developed a novel policy gradient method for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, we proposed a momentum-based decentralized policy gradient tracking (MDPGT) to approximate the local policy gradient surrogate with importance sampling.

HPC research, training, and development that prepares an HPC-aware workforce.       Selected science outcomes enabled by NOVA-Extension are described below.

Precision Agriculture. Computing on language-based descriptions of gene function and phenotype relies on the use of controlled vocabularies and strict graphs called ontologies. We have advanced tools for computing gene function and phenotype. For gene function, our system predicts functions more accurately for plant genomes for over twenty crop genomes. Our methods also allow researchers to compute directly on phenotype descriptions directly using natural language processing to recover biologically relevant associations to collect and document phenotype data in human-readable, highly technical terms. We also developed a probabilistic voxel carving algorithm to efficiently reconstruct 3D models of maize plants and extract leaf traits for phenotyping robustly.
