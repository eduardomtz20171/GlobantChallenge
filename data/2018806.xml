<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. The University of Memphis is acquiring a single crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped  with a copper source to support Professors Xuan Zhao, Charles Garner, Timothy Brewster, Kensha Clark, as well as other colleagues. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here impact many areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry, biochemistry and other engineering fields at this institution. In addition, the diffractometer has broad impact on teaching and training, outreach activities, and undergraduate research at the University of Memphis as well as regional partners from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) such as those from Arkansas State University, University of Central Arkansas and Rhodes College.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the X-ray diffractometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The science enabled by this instrument provides relevant societal benefits through the development of catalysts with redox-active ligands for activation of small molecules such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide which improve the synthesis of commodity and industrial chemicals. The instrumentation is also used for the characterization of transition metal-based frustrated Lewis pairs for activation and catalytic transformations involving small molecules like methane, and in the exploration of fundamental properties of binuclear metal complexes used for electron-transfer and cooperative catalysis reactions. In addition, it benefits preparation of catalysts for alkene hydrogenation reactions, and the structural characterization of catalytic intermediates during hydrogen production. The diffractometer is also used to characterize the structural conformations of biologically active molecules, and for studying host-guest chemistry of cyclic oligo-lactic acid with metal ions of biological significance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
