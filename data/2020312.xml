<AbstractNarration>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is driving considerable parts of the US economy, influencing almost every industrial and scientific sector. Yet, the "intelligence" of these systems still cannot match the flexibility and breadth of even simple biological systems. The objective of this project is to develop a revolutionary new class of AI by focusing on four insights from the biological intelligence (BI) of animals that, unlike current AI agents, (1) do not start as blank slates (2) do not forget when they learn new things (3) have curiosity, and (4) interpret the world in terms of cause and effect. This project brings together outstanding scientists from a wide variety of disciplines and diverse backgrounds to tackle this problem. Through planning meetings and collaborative exercises, the team will generate preliminary data, and preparatory work for a future center focused on reframing the fundamental question of "intelligence." Outreach efforts will engage many diverse participants through large-scale online teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the founding of AI, Alan Turing proposed a test to determine when an AI behaves like a BI, and specifically human intelligence (HI). This test set the stage for the following 70 years of AI development. It has largely been replaced by narrow competitions aimed at imitating humans at specific tasks, such as playing certain games, identifying objects, or translating languages. But neither the Turing test nor today’s AI competitions utilize modern conceptualizations of what it means to be intelligent. It has become clear that intelligence evolved to incorporate several complex capabilities, which are  critically missing from today’s AI: (1) preprogramming biases and baseline behaviors, (2) continually leveraging of many previous experiences to improve decision making in newly encountered tasks, (3) actively seeking out information that is useful for future decisions even if these differ from past decisions, and, finally, (4) constructing causal models relevant to decisions and communicating these models. This project brings together a unique group that truly understands both AI and BI/HI to address this gap. This group aims to define what is missing in AI relative to BI/HI, and to determine which research paths can enhance future approaches. In year one, the project will develop a test to measure a specific aspect of intelligence found in animals, but not current AI. This test will be sufficiently simple that it can be performed by several different biological taxa, humans, as well as AI. In year two, the participants will conduct pilot experiments to quantify current levels of performance on these tests and distill insights from BI/HI for AI. The resulting benchmarks will provide explicit and quantitative milestones for the eventual institute, whose goal will be to develop AI that matches HI on the new tests of intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Our project set out to rethink how artificial intelligence (AI) can generalize knowledge in a way that mirrors human learning. Traditional AI systems often struggle when faced with new situations that differ from their training data. To address this, we introduced the concept of "prospective learning," a new framework aimed at enabling AI to anticipate and adapt to future scenarios, much like humans do.   Major Activities:   Over the course of the project, we organized many collaborative meetings, bringing together experts from various fields, including neuroscience, psychology, and computer science. These meetings fostered interdisciplinary discussions that were crucial in shaping our new vision for AI. We produced a white paper and a peer-reviewed theory paper outlining the principles of prospective learning. Additionally, we submitted an NSF AI Institute proposal based on our work and are in the process of preparing another.   Our team also conducted experimental research to provide proof-of-concept for prospective learning. This included studies on how humans can learn abstract patterns in changing environments and how imagination aids in generalizing strategies across different tasks.   Significant Results:     Theoretical Framework: We developed a deep theoretical foundation for prospective learning, challenging the traditional "independent and identically distributed" (iid) assumption that limits AI generalization. Our work extends the foundational theories of AI to accommodate non-iid contexts, paving the way for more adaptable and intelligent systems.     Publications: Our findings were disseminated through a publicly available white paper and a peer-reviewed conference proceeding, increasing accessibility and encouraging community engagement with our research.     Grant Proposals: We submitted an NSF AI Institute proposal and an AFOSR proposal to secure funding for further research. While the first NSF proposal was not funded, the feedback received is being used to strengthen our next submission.     Intellectual Merit:   The project advances our understanding of how learning and generalization can be fundamentally restructured in AI. By moving beyond the limitations of current models, we address core challenges in creating AI systems that can adapt to new and unforeseen situations. Our interdisciplinary way of thinking bridges gaps between biological and artificial intelligence, fostering innovations that could lead to more robust and flexible AI technologies.   Broader Impacts:     Advancement of AI Technology: By redefining generalization in AI, our work has contributed to enhance our understanding how AI systems learn and adapt, benefiting a wide range of applications from robotics to data analysis.     Educational Opportunities: The project provided training and professional development for graduate students, involving them in cutting-edge research and interdisciplinary collaboration.     Dissemination of Knowledge: Through publications and presentations, we shared our findings with both the scientific community and the general public, promoting wider understanding and encouraging further research in prospective learning.     Future Research and Collaboration: The groundwork laid by this project opens avenues for future studies and collaborations, aiming to develop AI that can better handle real-world complexities.     Conclusion:   Our project successfully established a new framework for understanding and improving generalization in AI through prospective learning. By combining theoretical development with experimental validation, we have taken significant steps toward creating AI systems that can anticipate and adapt to future challenges. We are excited to continue this work, building on our findings to further advance the field of artificial intelligence.
