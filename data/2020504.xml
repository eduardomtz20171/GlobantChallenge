<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by promoting metacognition within the engineering curriculum and investigating the impact of metacognitive activities on student learning. Metacognition is the ability to reflect on, understand, and control oneâ€™s learning. Learning theories have shown that self-regulated and reflective learning are important for acquisition and application of new knowledge. Metacognition is therefore important for learning in the engineering classroom as well as for success in the professional engineering workplace. This project will design and implement systematic metacognitive activities in a fluid mechanics course at the University of South Florida. This course uses a flipped classroom model in which class time will be used for students to work collaboratively, including work on metacognitive activities. To determine the impact of the metacognitive activities, students who are taught fluid mechanics using the metacognitive approach will be compared with a control group of students who are taught in the traditional way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate cognitive, reflective, and affective student outcomes associated with systematic metacognition.  The flipped classroom pedagogy will be used to ensure that there is sufficient time available for in-class metacognitive practice activities consisting of Plan/Monitor/Evaluate cycles embedded within fluid mechanics problems. Assessment of student outcomes will include direct assessment of cognitive knowledge, as well as student reflections related to their metacognitive activities. Additionally, indirect assessment of student metacognition will be accomplished through a validated inventory. The multiple assessment methods are intended to enable data triangulation to obtain valid and reliable conclusions. Diverse student perspectives on systematic metacognitive instruction and practice will be gathered using focus groups that include female, underrepresented minority students, and community college transfer students. Systematic, formal integration of metacognitive activities is expected to enhance student learning. Learning materials, best practices, and outcomes will be shared with other STEM faculty at the institution.  The findings and lessons learned will be disseminated via open educational courseware, conference presentations, journal articles, and workshops. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This three-year study investigated the impact of metacognition support in an undergraduate Fluid Mechanics course, where complex problems must be solved by students. Students were asked weekly to reflect relative to their planning, monitoring, and evaluation of the in-class problem-solving and other course activities. In addition, they received intentional instruction on how to plan, monitor, and evaluate their problem-solving during class. Together, the weekly reflection and intentional instruction on planning, monitoring, and evaluation comprised the metacognition support provided. Planning, monitoring, and evaluation form the self-management, or self-regulatory, aspect of metacognition, which supports lifelong learning and performance. To enable a comparison, sections of the course without the metacognition support were implemented during other semesters. The weekly reflections were analyzed by two researchers to study students self-regulatory behaviors and investigate associations between the reflections and measures of student knowledge.   One of the key findings of this research was that being careful, organized, and diligent in ones course work may be as aligned with a students course performance in STEM as is practice with the problem solving itself. Also, based on an inventory that specifically measures metacognitive skillfulness with problem solving, there was a significantly higher change (from the beginning to the end of the course), with an effect size of d = 0.22, for the group that received the metacognition support versus the group that did not. The metacognition support was also associated with positive effects on the final exam, particularly for the open-ended problem solving (d = 0.46). Upon asking students to reflect on the weekly reflection itself, we found they viewed it foremost as a vehicle for academic support (i.e., 67% of students), including support for performance, study habits, content understanding, exam preparation, accountability, and improvement. Overall, our assessment pointed to the desirability and positive impact of providing metacognition support in a STEM course and uncovered reasons why its desirable.   As we learned, metacognition support, including regular reflection, is a practice that can be readily implemented by other educators. Although its incorporation in the engineering curriculum has been limited in general, it should be an intentional component of the engineering curriculum. The results of this study have been published in two separate articles in the International Journal of Mechanical Engineering Education. Based on the promising outcomes, our ongoing dissemination efforts include inspiring other instructors through formal and informal talks to intentionally promote metacognition development and to educate their students about the potential impact of academic self-management, including exhibiting carefulness, diligence, and organization in their work. We will continue to call for replication studies of our study to explore the impact in other courses, academic disciplines, and schools.
