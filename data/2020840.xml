<AbstractNarration>A core problem in understanding constraints on syntax in human languages is understanding constraints on long-distance dependencies, such as in “Which sportscar did the color of __ delight the baseball player?” The long-distance dependency between the wh-phrase (a question word or phrase beginning with “wh”) “which sportscar” and its interpretation position following “color of” is not acceptable in English. This kind of observation led Chomsky  to propose that constraints on long-distance dependencies may be innate and unlearnable: part of Universal Grammar.  An alternative approach proposes that the difficulty of a long-distance dependency depends on the discourse status of the extracted element in the construction at hand: the extracted element is a focus (corresponding to new information) in wh-questions, but not in relative clauses.  The current project investigates predictions of the two kinds of accounts.  The results will inform theories about the form of extraction constraints in English and French, and human language more generally.  This project will provide interdisciplinary training to a postdoctoral student and to undergraduate students, including under-represented minorities. This research will build connections between the fields of experimental psychology, cognitive science and linguistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research to be conducted here consists of behavioral acceptability experiments in English and French, in cases of extraction out of subjects, and in extraction out of adjuncts, which have also been claimed to be difficult to extract from in the syntactic literature. For example, according to a discourse-based theory, extractions from subjects will improve even in wh-questions if the extraction position can be marked as a focus, e.g., with contrastive focus markers like “even” and “only”, as in “Which sportscar did even the color of __ delight the baseball player?”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project sought to evaluate the acceptability of sentences involving long-distance dependencies within and across languages. Such materials have been critical in the development of syntactic theories, most notably the so-called generative theories of Noam Chomsky and his followers. According to Chomsky and his collaborators, there are two components to the syntax of natural languages: a structure combination component (called merge for Chomsky, but phrase structure or dependency structure more generally), where words and phrases are put together; and a movement component, where the pieces can move around.Prominent alternative theories dont have a movement component, only the phrase structure or dependency structure. An important claim from Chomsky and colleagues is that the movement is restricted, so that some structures are possible (like (1a) below) but others are not (1b):    (1)a. Who did you hear [stories about __]? (Chomsky, 1973, 86b)   b. *Who did [stories about __] terrify John? (Chomsky, 1973, 92b)    It is furthermore claimed that the movement constraints are the same for all constructions where there are long-distance connections.    In this project, we evaluated several of the claims of the movement-based theories: (1) whether the movement constraints are the same for all constructions; (2) whether there needs to be a movement process, leaving behind an empty element or trace of movement, or alternatively, whether the elements can directly connect.    Our results show that, first, there are different constraints on different kinds of dependencies, contrary to Chomskys hypothesis. For example, an extraction from a wh-question is more constrained than extraction from an exclamative:    (2)a. Simple wh-question: Which nice jacket did you buy ?   b. Simple exclamative: What a nice jacket you bought !   c. Complex wh-question: Which nice jacket do you think I bought ?   d. Complex exclamative: What a nice jacket I think you bought !    (2d) is much worse than (2c), contrary to movement theories, but consistent with usage-based theories.    And second, our results suggest that there are no empty elements in these long-distance dependencies at all. If there were ECs, then the materials in (3) would all be the same behavioral complexity, since the dependency distances would be matched for the wh-elements and the locations of the ECs. Alternatively, without ECs, there would be a cline in complexity across the four, such that (3a) is the best and (3d) is the worst. This is what the data suggest, arguing against the EC theory.    (3) a. PP-filler1; PP-filler2:This is the saucer [on which] Mary put the cup [into which] she poured the milk.   b. PP-filler1; NP-filler2:This is the saucer [on which] Mary put the cup [which] she poured the milk into.   c. NP-filler1; PP-filler2:This is the saucer [which] Mary put the cup [into which] she poured the milk on.   d. NP-filler1; NP-filler2:This is the saucer [which] Mary put the cup [which] she poured the milk into on.    The alternative view is one where long-distance dependencies are formed directly between the elements that are connected (with no empty elements) and the badness of some connections is driven by the frequency of the use of the particular combinations, and by the target meaning, which can sometimes be bizarre.
