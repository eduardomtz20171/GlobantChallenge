<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by developing a scalable data-science Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) in genomics for increasing quantitative literacy and persistence in undergraduate students. The project will employ a CURE to engage students in genuine scientific research as part of the course curriculum. Data science projects will be developed to create a scalable CURE that can be offered at both community colleges and four-year teaching institutions to impact diverse student populations. As such, this project will increase access to research opportunities for primarily teaching colleges and their students to increase participation in data science. By exploring the efficacy of a data science CURE as an intervention, this project will provide insights on how to increase quantitative literacy and persistence in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to investigate how CUREs can increase student persistence and improve analytical skills. In particular, the project aims to generate knowledge on how a data science intensive CURE impacts the student learning outcomes. The outcomes will be evaluated for student populations at a research university (Johns Hopkins University) and a community college (Clovis Community College, a teaching institution with a student population that is 40% Hispanic and 20% first-generation). A validated tool assessing factors linked to persistence in STEM (PITS) will be used to investigate whether a data science CURE can produce increases in these factors similar to those seen in previously established CUREs. Similarly, the recently validated BioSQuaRE tool will be used to assess improvements in quantitative skills. Evaluating these measures with two very different student populations and institutional settings will expand knowledge of CURE impacts and lay the groundwork for comparisons across a wide range of student populations. The project will also investigate student attitudes towards data science and evaluate whether incorporating data science lab modules in a lower-division undergraduate course is an effective strategy to attract and prepare students to participate in scientific research opportunities. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Early-stage students at community colleges and institutions with limited research activity need authentic research experiences. Increasing course-based research experiences would help instructors engage these students in the scientific process by teaching through research. Through the C-MOOR project, we are working to lower barriers for first generation and limited income students by opening pathways into genomic data science. We describe our efforts to modernize biology curricula through our NSF project titled "Exploring the Impacts of Data Science Education through a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) and Short Lab Modules" in collaboration between Carnegie Institution, Johns Hopkins University (JHU), and Clovis Community College (CCC).    We developed two types of research experiences: a shorter "miniCURE" and a full semester CURE. Both offer hands-on experience with real data using tools employed by practicing scientists such as R, Bioconductor, and cloud computing. Interactive tutorials are available through SciServer, a cloud-based computing and data storage platform created by the JHU Institute for Data-Intensive Engineering and Science. Online delivery allows completion of exercises using only a web browser and an internet connection. Importantly, these experiences are accessible to early stage students, requiring only high school science and algebra with no programming experience required.    The shorter miniCURE begins with core labs that explore existing knowledge through Scientific Literature and Biological Databases and then use computational tools for RNA-seq Analysis and Differential Gene Expression. Afterwards, students develop a capstone scientific poster through project work sessions that can be scheduled around existing material. This two-phase structure allowed us to integrate the miniCURE into existing introductory biology and genetics courses at CCC and Notre Dame of Maryland University (NDMU), and pilot at Din College. Combined, we reached over 500 students, 90% in their first college year, most with little to no coding experience, and more than half presenting their poster at an optional symposium. More details will be described in a manuscript submitted to CourseSource and we continue to assess student outcomes by analyzing student posters.    Complementing the shorter miniCURE is our full semester CURE which provides a more in-depth research experience. This full semester CURE focuses on single cell RNA-seq analysis and expands upon the miniCURE through modules such as Cell Identity and Gene Expression, Single Cell Analysis, and Pathway Analysis. R-based data analysis is scaffolded by gradually transitioning from LearnR interactive tutorials to the full featured RStudio environment. We taught this curriculum three times at CCC and videos from several C-MOOR Scholars who completed this coursework can be seen at https://www.c-moor.org.    Across both formats, we found that emphasizing science rather than coding helps motivate students to learn how to programmatically analyze data. As this is often the first research project, we also found that students require scaffolding the research process and stressing that negative results are integral steps in generating more interesting questions to test. We found that community college students face challenges commiting to full semester CUREs due to pressure to transfer with the fewest credits possible and are often unaware of the professional value that research-based classes provide. These challenges can be addressed by integrating miniCUREs into introductory courses which helps mitigate barriers that impact underrepresented populations and gives students time to take necessary coursework.    Our curriculum emphasizes scientific posters to scaffold student research and provide a product to showcase student work. This product helps students apply for additional research experiences, and during tours of research intensive universities, enriches their interactions with other scientists. Locally, posters displayed in hallways create excitement among students and complement the presence of C-MOOR Scholars embedded as near peer tutors. These posters catalyzed the creation of an annual STEM Research Symposium at CCC, one of only five across the entire California Community Colleges system. And at NDMU, the inaugural miniCURE resulted in a first-place award in the Biological Sciences category, an award that previously only upper-level students had won.    Overall, we developed a modular framework to provide students with research experiences that can be shared through the Genomic Data Science Community Network (GDSCN) and the California Community Colleges. This initiative fostered partnerships such as the Five-in-Five masters program at Fresno State, an NIH award between NDMU and CCC to develop additional datasets, and a collaboration with the GDSCN BioDIGS consortium to create an additional miniCURE and CURE. We continue to address the need for faculty professional development and note that miniCUREs provide a great first step that was found doable by all four instructors, none of whom are trained data scientists. Through these efforts we continue to mobilize talented students, bridge the skills gap at institutions that serve students with limited resources, and enrich the genomics data science community.
