<AbstractNarration>Researchers at the University of Delaware (UD) and at Colgate University will revise and implement a course on polar science in the media. The course will equip students with the technical skills, including computer programming skills taught using a pair-programming approach, to evaluate geoscience data reported in the media and will place this data within a personal context using narratives that convey scientific information. Over the course of the project, ~100 non-geoscience major students will be immersed in a student-centered, data-driven course. Evaluations will focus on improving students' ability to analyze and understand the implications of data and on the transferability of the course materials to different institutions. The impact of this project will extend well beyond the award period through continued offerings at UD and Colgate University, by distributing the course and pedagogy content through the NSF-sponsored Science Education Resource Center (SERC) as the primary conduit to geoscience educators and through professional development workshops offered to new and existing geoscience instructors at major geoscience conferences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new polar science course for non-STEM majors will be designed and implemented. The course is based on a combination of cognitivism and constructivism and with quantitative metrics for assessing student progress on technical and narrative challenges. Evaluations will address the hypothesis that student exposure to a pair-programming pedagogy will improve their technical data access and interpretation skills and the hypothesis that students exposed to developed narrative structure exercises will demonstrate improved perspective-taking skills and will be able to demonstrate better understanding the narrative context in which the data are presented. The project is co-funded by the Office of Polar Programs and the Division of Undergraduate Education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      In a world inundated with information claiming scientific validity, students face the challenge of discerning credible sources amidst misinformation. This reality has sparked a focus on fact-checking in education, often detracting from teaching core scientific principles. Both instructors and students struggleteachers with maintaining focus on foundational concepts and learners with navigating conflicting information. To address this, a new teaching model integrates cognitive and constructivist pedagogies, emphasizing not only scientific accuracy but also the narratives that convey this information. This approach is particularly applied in geoscience education, where news media serves as a dual tool for examining scientific data and analyzing narrative structures aimed at persuasion.  Two Pedagogical Challenges    Our project addresses two core challenges:        Cognitive Challenge: Equipping students with the technical skills to access, analyze, and evaluate geoscience data reported in the media.        Constructivist Challenge: Helping students recognize and critically evaluate the narratives shaping the presentation of scientific information.        By tackling these challenges, the approach aims to prepare both STEM and non-STEM students to be scientifically literate and engaged citizens in an interconnected, digital age.  Project Overview    This initiative aligns with the NSF Dear Colleague Letter (NSF 19-086) and the IUSE: EHR Program Track 1, Engaged Student Learning (ESL). Specifically, it focuses on integrating polar geoscience research into undergraduate education and exploring innovative tools, resources, and teaching methods. Key project components included:        Designing metrics to assess student responses to technical and narrative challenges in polar geoscience media.        Developing course modules interweaving technical and narrative analysis.        Distributing the active learning pedagogy through online platforms and workshops.      Key Methodologies and Findings    To build technical skills, treatment classes incorporated instruction in the statistical programming language R, using a pair-programming pedagogy. Students followed video-based tutorials to replicate R code for discovering, graphing, and analyzing geoscience data. A control group did not receive this instruction. Results showed that the treatment group significantly improved in data graphing and analysis compared to the control group, validating the effectiveness of this technical training.    To address the narrative aspect, students evaluated geoscience claims and news articles from eight predefined perspectives, ranging from positive (e.g., science enabling technological advances) to negative (e.g., science causing environmental degradation) to neutral. Pre- and post-surveys assessed students dispositional empathy for differing viewpoints, with responses linked to individual characteristics like gender when possible. While survey results showed minimal change, with a potential false-positive increase in empathy within the treatment group, focus group feedback suggested students felt more empathetic in the treatment setting.  Implications for Education    This model demonstrates that integrating technical and narrative analyses into geoscience education can enhance students' technical skills while fostering critical thinking about the societal dimensions of science. While quantitative survey results on empathy were inconclusive, qualitative feedback indicated promise in building empathy and awareness of diverse perspectives. By combining cognitive and constructivist approaches, this pedagogy encourages students not only to assess data critically but also to understand and evaluate the broader stories shaping scientific discourse.    Through this approach, geoscience education can empower students to navigate the complexities of science communication, fostering a more informed and engaged citizenry.
