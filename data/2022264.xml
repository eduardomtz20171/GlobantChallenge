<AbstractNarration>This RAPID project intends to collect GPS data in the immediate aftermath of the Puerto Rico earthquake sequence that included the January 7, 2020 magnitude 6.4 mainshock. This is the largest earthquake recorded in the region since 1918. Understanding key aspects of the tectonic and seismic processes in the area will be critical to placing this recent earthquake swarm into context. Three decades of monitoring using GPS has revealed that the southwestern part of Puerto Rico is moving independently from the rest of the island. This work will add to the understanding of how the island is deforming before and after the earthquake sequence in addition to understanding earthquake displacements. The project supports a Hispanic-Serving Institution, and includes significant outreach to the local community related to these seismic events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since December 29, 2020,the southwestern region of the Puerto Rico-Virgin Islands microplate has been hit by an extensive earthquake swarm, with several magnitude 5 earthquakes and a mainshock of 6.4 that occurred on January 7, 2020. The region has seen significant devestation, a displaced population and anxiety with the continued sequence. Several faults have been identified in the region. However, the most probable causative fault has been recently discovered, the North Boqueron-Punta Montalva fault. Instrumenting the fault is critical to assess seismic and tsunami risk in the region. This project will re-measure all 18 campaign GPS sites in the PRVI tectonic block and install 6 temporary real-time GNSS sites. The goal is to quantify the motion of the southwestern Puerto Rico block and understand which faults are accommodating motion. The geodetic data that is collected will help researchers to estimate how the recent seismic activity is associated with elastic strain accumulation on the landward extension of the fault.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Mw6.4 January 7, 2020 Southwestern Puerto Rico earthquake is the largest earthquake recorded in Puerto Rico since October 1918. The shallow hypocenter and proximity to the southern coast of the island resulted in millions of dollars in damage, one death and thousands injured. The seismic sequence associated to this earthquake began one month prior and aftershocks were felt in the following years. Seismic behavior studies revealed a very productive seismic sequence occurring on multiple faults. Immediately after the mainshock, the Puerto Rico Seismic Network (PRSN) requested NSF-RAPID funds to study co-seismic and post-seismic deformation of the region by re-measuring the existing campaign GPS network and installing 6 new permanent GNSS stations in Southwestern Puerto Rico. In the early stages of seismic release, PRSN and USGS scientists believed the causative was an offshore southeastward extension of the North Boquern Bay - Punta Montalva (NBB-PM) fault. The need to study relative motions on the fault was critical to estimate whether an on-shore progression along the fault northwestward would have been possible, as this would have resulted in further destruction and loss of lives. At the moment of the earthquake, only three permanent GPS stations existed in the region. Having more stations in the region was necessary to help identify faults accommodating the motion. Southwestern Puerto Rico is known for being the predominant region within the island to show heightened seismic activity. Most of the seismic activity occurs along the boundaries of the Puerto Rico - Virgin Islands block. However, decade-long GPS studies have help show a correlation between the microseismic activity of Puerto Rico's southwestern portion with separate Southwestern Puerto Rico (SWPR) block motion with respect to the rest of the PRVI's block. This behavior has been used to suggest that the deformation of PRVI's block western boundary, the Mona Passage, occurs in a wide area that connects northern Hispaniola to the Muerto's Trough south of Puerto Rico. The installation and deployment of the new 6 permanent GNSS stations cover three municipalities in southwest Puerto Rico, and are strategically located surrounding the NBB-PM fault. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the installation of the Short-drilled Braced Monuments was not possible immediately after the mainshock. UNAVCO (now EarthScope - GAGE) purchased and prepared all the necessary equipment and then shipped it to Puerto Rico by the Fall of 2020. The first GNSS site was operational on November 2020 and the last on July 2021. By the summer of 2023, two years of data on the 6 sites was able to pick-up post-seismic deformation in the region, and a slowly return behavior to inter-seismic vectors. In addition, funds from the grant were employed in the campaign to re-occupy campaign GPS sites all around the PRVI block, including sites in the British Virgin Islands. The updated velocity field was critical for two reasons; (1) to augment the time-series by more than two decades and confirm the rigid block behavior of the PRVI block with a separate SWPR block, and (2) to provide valuable information for the 2025 update of the Puerto Rico Seismic Hazard Map in preparation by the USGS.
