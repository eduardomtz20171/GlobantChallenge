<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on the design and testing of a system capable of long-term field deployment that uses sound to monitor seagrass biomass and productivity with significantly improved temporal resolution compared to traditional techniques. Long-term continuous measurements of relevant parameters of ecosystem production are of primary importance for ecosystem health assessment and sustainable management. Dissolved oxygen measurements made with optical sensors are the most widely used method for estimating seagrass photosynthesis in relation to underwater irradiance. Oxygen evolution is also critical in maintaining aerobic conditions for below ground seagrass roots and rhizomes that constitute 60-80% of total plant biomass. However, under oxygen saturation conditions, which occurs frequently in summer under high light conditions, free gas bubbles are continuously released by the plants. Optical sensors are unable to detect bubbles under such supersaturated conditions, leading to underestimates in seagrass photosynthetic carbon production. Since oxygen saturation occurs more readily at higher temperatures and light conditions that are most prevalent from the late spring to early fall months, accurate determinations of productivity are only possible under low light conditions or in the early morning hours. Since sound propagation in water is very sensitive to the presence of bubbles, acoustic methods provide an alternative measure of true photosynthetic oxygen production in seagrass meadows with high temporal resolution. The researchers will engage in outreach activities including the Freshman Research Initiative (FRI) at University of Texas at Austin (UT), which gives first-year students the opportunity to initiate and engage in real-world research experience with faculty and graduate students. The project will also engage grades K-16 through the development of a Data Nugget based on the long-term data set collected through the proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The stand-alone field-deployed system will use broadband acoustic measurements to remotely sense both seagrass biomass and gas ebullition. The system will consist of three main components: 1) an acoustic source projector and a set of receiving hydrophones, 2) an instrumentation pressure vessel (IPV) that houses the electronics controlling the acoustic data acquisition and data storage, and 3) a suite of environmental sensor-loggers.  The proposed measurement system will be made compact and lightweight enough that it can be hand-deployed in the seagrass meadow from a small watercraft that is capable of accessing the shallow bays of the Texas Gulf of Mexico coast. The target deployment water depth is 2-3 m, which reflects the maximum depths of seagrass distribution in Texas coastal waters. Geoacoustic inference techniques will be applied to quantify the void fraction of gas in the seawater as well as the gas volume present within the seagrass tissue. Bayesian techniques will be used to assess parameter uncertainties and reveal parameter correlations. Low-frequency sound (&lt;3 kHz) is most sensitive to gas entrained within the seagrass tissue, and an effective medium model which accounts for the seagrass tissue elasticity and structure of seagrass leaves is being developed to quantify the gas volume present within the seagrass leaves, roots, and rhizomes. Mid-frequency sound (3.5 to 35 kHz) is most sensitive to  free bubbles in the water resulting from seagrass photosynthesis. The void fraction of gas in the water can be related to oxygen production by accounting for vertical transport of oxygen bubbles to the sea surface. The data from this system will be used to build new connections between seagrass condition indicators and environmental stressors. This research will lead to predictions of seagrass responses to climate change by accounting for both trend- and event-driven perturbations that affect physical forcing factors such as light transmission, water circulation, temperature, and salinity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>An acoustic system to monitor seagrass biomass and productivity was developed and deployed in a meadow of Thalassia testudinum in the East Flats area of Corpus Christi Bay for a period of two years. The monitoring system consists of a broadband acoustic projector and set of four hydrophones that collect acoustic recordings every ten minutes. These recordings were used to calculate transmission loss and ambient sound. Transmission loss represents the decrease in intensity of wave propagating outward from a source, and it was calculated from measurements of the signals broadcast by the projector. Ambient sound describes the naturally occurring sounds in the environment, and it was assessed from the portion of the recordings that did not include the signal receptions. A suite of environmental sensor loggers including dissolved oxygen, depth, temperature, and salinity sensors were deployed with the acoustic system. Photosynthetically active radiation data was collected using a sensor mounted on a nearby fishing cabin approximately 200 m from the acoustic measurement system, and atmospheric measurements were acquired from Mustang Beach Airport approximately 3 km away. The acoustic data were interpreted in the context of the environmental measurements.&nbsp;</p> <p>The diurnal pattern of photosynthesis is evident in the transmission loss data. The highest loss is observed in the late afternoons in the summer when the seagrass is most productive. The daily increase in transmission loss occurs when the dissolved oxygen level exceeds 100% saturation and free bubbles are found attached to the seagrass leaves and in the water. These bubbles are responsible for the increased transmission loss, which is due to dispersion, absorption, and scattering of sound by the bubbles. On cloudy days, when there is not sufficient sunlight to drive photosynthesis, the dissolved oxygen level stays below 100% saturation and the increased transmission loss does not occur.&nbsp;</p> <p>A seasonal pattern is also clearly observable in the acoustic measurements, and it is consistent over both years of data. Transmission loss is low through the early part of year, begins to increase in late April, reaches its highest levels in July, and slowly decays to its lowest levels by mid-November. This pattern follows the life cycle of Thalassia testudinum, which is most productive in the warmer season when above-ground biomass is at its annual peak. Gas bodies contained within the seagrass tissue cause the seasonal increase in transmission loss. In the warmer season, there is also a diurnal effect as the gas bodies become pressurized during the photosynthetic period in the afternoon, and the loss decays over the night time hours as gas is diffused from the leaves into the surrounding water.

The annual oxygen balance was computed with and without the non-dissolved contribution of oxygen, and the following metrics were computed for the calendar year 2022. Overall, the seagrass metabolism was autotrophic (NEM&gt;0). March and November were heterotrophic (NEM&lt;0), as was December when the contribution from bubbles was not included. The annual average NEM was 14 mmol O2 m-2d-1 without the non-dissolved contribution and 19 mmol O2 m-2d-1 with the non-dissolved contribution. Therefore, the estimated annual carbon uptake is 36% greater when oxygen ebullition is included in the calculation. These results further establish seagrass meadows as important sinks in the global carbon cycle because they are highly productive systems that bury organic carbon. The restoration of seagrass ecosystems has been identified as method of marine carbon dioxide removal. The techniques developed under this grant to monitor seagrass productivity were selected for further investment by the Sensing Exports of Anthropogenic Carbon through Ocean Observation (SEA-CO2) program sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 12/11/2023<br> Modified by: Megan&nbsp;S&nbsp;Ballard</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2023211/2023211_10688402_1702328286849_NSF_Outcomes--rgov-214x142.png" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2023211/2023211_10688402_1702328286849_NSF_Outcomes--rgov-800width.png" title="NSF Outcomes"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2023211/2023211_10688402_1702328286849_NSF_Outcomes--rgov-66x44.png" alt="NSF Outcomes"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Environmental measurements shown with transmission loss calculated in the 1 to 100 kHz band at a range of 6 m and 25th percentile level of ambient sound in the 1 to 10 kHz band.
