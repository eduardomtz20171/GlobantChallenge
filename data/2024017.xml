<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Lack of optical materials compatible with common semiconductor substrates presents a standing hurdle for integrated photonic device development in the mid-IR domain. This award supports a collaborative team to conduct fundamental research to advance knowledge for the integration of emerging optical nanomaterials with the mid-IR photonics platform. The research aims to enable the design, fabrication, and integration of mid-IR photonic components and circuits based on a new optical nanomaterial, namely two-dimensional (2-D) tellurene. Tellurene, atomically thin crystals of elemental tellurium, is an emerging 2-D material amenable to scalable synthesis and uniquely combines small and tunable bandgap energies, high carrier mobility, exceptionally large electro-optic activity, and superior chemical stability, which makes it a promising and versatile material platform for mid-IR photonics. The mid-IR spectral band (2-20 micro-meter) is of significant technological importance for thermal imaging, spectroscopic sensing, infrared countermeasures, and free-space communications. The proposed tellurene-based device platform, once demonstrated, will have a transformative impact on mid-IR integrated photonics. The envisioned detector and modulator devices both are predicted to have performances far exceeding the state-of-the-art. This research involves several disciplines, including materials science, electrical engineering, photonics, device physics, manufacturing, and chemistry. The multi-disciplinary research combined with the proposed outreach activities will provide valuable opportunities for exposing the students to cutting-edge nanotechnology and optical sciences to inspire their interest in STEM career paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2-D materials have emerged as a promising material group for photonic integration, given their singular optical properties not found in conventional bulk and thin-film materials. However, some scientific and technical barriers are yet to be overcome to realize the full application potential of 2-D materials for mid-IR integrated photonics. This research is to fill the knowledge gap on the integration of solution-synthesized tellurene with the mid-IR photonics platform. The objectives are (1) to demonstrate high-performance waveguide integrated room-temperature mid-IR photodetectors and ultrafast electro-optic modulators based on tellurene, and (2) to explore the unique advantage and capability of solution-synthesized tellurene as a novel optical material for integrated mid-IR photonic devices. The research team will innovate a processing scheme that directly fabricates waveguide structures on tellurene using compositionally-engineered chalcogenide glass as both the light guiding medium and an infrared-transparent gate dielectric. This monolithic approach capitalizes on the broadband mid-IR transparency and near-room-temperature processing of chalcogenide glass to not only simplify the integration process but also allow the photonic circuit to be specifically optimized and precisely aligned to tellurene crystals with lithographic accuracy. The team will also develop a physics-based framework to design and guide the material synthesis, device fabrication, and system integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

Based on the previous studies on the effect of Te precursors (TeO<sub>2</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub>), solution basicity, and the reductant concentration on the growth of tellurene (along the length [0001] and width direction [1210]), the reaction parameters are carefully modulated to establish a further reduction on the standard deviation of the flakes&rsquo; thickness and sizez. When TeO<sub>2</sub> is used as the Te precursor, there would be an additional step for TeO<sub>2</sub> to dissolve into an ammonia solution. Therefore, at the same amount of initial NH<sub>4</sub>OH and N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> addition, the actual basicity of the reaction solution would be drastically different considering the same tellurium concentration. The variation of OH<sup>-</sup> concentrations in the hydrothermal reaction process at both the same initial NH<sub>4</sub>OH addition or the same initial OH<sup>-</sup> concentrations using both precursors are visualized in Figure 1. According to Figure 1, with the same initial NH<sub>4</sub>OH addition, the initial basicity of the reaction solution would be drastically different and, therefore, highly impact the initial nucleation process, whereas if the initial basicity is kept the same, the Te would experience a different growth, or in the other word, different Ostwald ripening process with, for the TeO<sub>2</sub> as the precursor, a more crowding solution with irrelevant ion NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>. To further elucidate the effect of the initial nucleation process, separate batches of tellurene are prepared with a room temperature (RT) nucleation process. The thickness and sizes of the growth outcome are summarized in Figure 2 and Figure 3, respectively.</p> <p>In a relatively low initial basicity, the thickness of the as-grown Te flakes would be smaller. It can be attributed to the enhanced initial nucleation, which can also be cross-validated by the smaller final thickness of room-temperature nucleated batches. From equation (1) and (2), the redox reaction from &nbsp;to Te yields two net , therefore decreasing the concentration of &nbsp;would speed up the reaction, leaving insufficient free Te atoms in the solution for the following further ripening of the tellurene crystals along the thickness direction. Combining the above exploration, it is found that using TeO<sub>2</sub> as precursor, a moderate basicity, as well as a reduced N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> amount can achieve best homogeneity considering the thickness, and scalable preparation of Te flakes with different average thickness and minimized standard deviation can be achieved based on such concept. The detailed thickness distributions of average flake thickness of ~20 nm, ~30 nm, and ~40 nm are shown in Figure 4. This enables the facile solution-based Langmuir&ndash;Blodgett (LB) transfer of the Te flakes' spectroscopic sensing to arbitrary substrates for the following device fabrication.</p> <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Dry transfer</p> <p>The PMMA-assisted dry transfer of 2D Te flakes is adapted from conventional PMMA-assisted dry transfer of 2D materials<sup>[2]</sup>. As shown in Figure 5, the as-synthesized Te flakes are LB transferred to a glass slide for smaller adhesiveness between the substrate and Te flakes. Then, one drop of PMMA was dropped on top of the desired Te flake. The PMMA was dried at 180 &deg;C to solidify into a film for 1 min. Then, the PMMA layer with Te flakes can be delaminated from the glass slide either directly using a tweezer or using water as an intercalating layer. One droplet of DI water was dropped at the target area to assist the alignment process and form better contact between Te flakes and the target substrate. Then, the PMMA layer was attached to the liquid film, and the Te flake was aligned using the optical microscope with the lubrication of the water film. After the alignment and drying of the water film, the target substrate with the PMMA film would go through another annealing process at 120 &deg;C to further enhance the adhesion between Te flakes and the target substrate. Finally, the substrate would be put into acetone to remove the PMMA. The optical images of the PMMA-assisted etchant free dry transfer of 2D Te flakes are shown in Figure 6.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 01/05/2024<br> Modified by: Wenzhuo&nbsp;Wu</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476930392_Slide3--rgov-214x142.JPG" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476930392_Slide3--rgov-800width.JPG" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476930392_Slide3--rgov-66x44.JPG" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 3: Size distribution of 2D tellurene prepared under different growth conditions.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wenzhuo Wu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wenzhuo&nbsp;Wu <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476950414_Slide4--rgov-214x142.JPG" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476950414_Slide4--rgov-800width.JPG" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476950414_Slide4--rgov-66x44.JPG" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 4: Thickness distribution of 2D tellurene prepared under different growth conditions.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wenzhuo Wu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wenzhuo&nbsp;Wu <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476997288_Slide6--rgov-214x142.JPG" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476997288_Slide6--rgov-800width.JPG" title="Figure 6"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476997288_Slide6--rgov-66x44.JPG" alt="Figure 6"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 6: Optical image of the PMMA assisted dry transfer process.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wenzhuo Wu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wenzhuo&nbsp;Wu <div class="imageTitle">Figure 6</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476970718_Slide5--rgov-214x142.JPG" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476970718_Slide5--rgov-800width.JPG" title="Figure 5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476970718_Slide5--rgov-66x44.JPG" alt="Figure 5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 5: Schematics of the PMMA assisted dry transfer process (inset: photo of the PMMA film with Te flakes).</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wenzhuo Wu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wenzhuo&nbsp;Wu <div class="imageTitle">Figure 5</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476813554_Slide1--rgov-214x142.JPG" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476813554_Slide1--rgov-800width.JPG" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476813554_Slide1--rgov-66x44.JPG" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: Variation of OH- concentrations during the hydrothermal reaction process use TeO2 or Na2TeO3 precursors and NH4OH as pH stabilizing agent.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Wenzhuo Wu</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wenzhuo&nbsp;Wu <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476901901_Slide2--rgov-214x142.JPG" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476901901_Slide2--rgov-800width.JPG" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2024017/2024017_10695447_1704476901901_Slide2--rgov-66x44.JPG" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2: Thickness distribution of 2D tellurene prepared under different growth conditions (blue: same, high initial basicity;
