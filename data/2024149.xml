<AbstractNarration>Visualization, the graphical representation of information and data, has become an integral part of data science with diverse and practical applications. This project is a travel grant that supports student attendees of the Doctoral Colloquium at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Visualization Conference (IEEE VIS) 2020. The IEEE VIS conference is the premier forum for advances in visualization, which consists of IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST), IEEE Information Visualization (InfoVis), IEEE Scientific Visualization (SciVis), together with various workshops and associated events. The IEEE VIS 2020 conference will take place in Salt Lake City, Utah, between October 25 and October 30, 2020. The Doctoral Colloquium at IEEE VIS is a single-day event taking place the day before the IEEE VIS conference. It is a forum that fosters the growth of young researchers in the field of visualization. The colloquium began in 2006 and has been a highly successful event where Ph.D. students present their proposed dissertation work and receive mentorship from senior researchers. Many of its previous attendees have become leaders in visualization. The colloquium aims at diversity among the student participants. The diversity among students presenters and faculty panelists across multi-dimensions will help all participants to appreciate different perspectives and to think critically about diversity in education. The colloquium also helps to establish and strengthen professional networks and research collaborations among junior and senior researchers, which are beneficial for the junior researchers, and critical for the advancement of the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award supports 18 Ph.D. students in visualization who are in the process of formulating or have just formulated a dissertation topic. During the colloquium, these students will discuss their research topics in a supportive environment with a panel of 6 to 8 distinguished researchers and faculties. They will also interact closely with their peers. They will receive feedback on their dissertation as well as advice on their career paths. The Doctoral Colloquium is a community-building experience that connects junior and senior researchers. It focuses on the participantsâ€™ doctoral dissertation research. The student participants are selected based on their research excellence and experiences. The colloquium also provides a forum for students to exchange research ideas, communicate their on-going works, and improve upon their research agendas. It encourages intellectual conversations and stimulating discussions. The works presented at the event also reflects the state-of-the-art in visualization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
