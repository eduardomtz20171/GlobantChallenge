<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 55-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum.  The Belmont Forum is a consortium of research funding organizations focused on support for transdisciplinary approaches to global environmental change challenges and opportunities.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in this Collaborative Research Action, the partner agencies have provided support to foster global transdisciplinary research teams of natural (including climate), health and social scientists and stakeholders from across the globe to improve understanding of climate, environment and health pathways to protect and promote health. The projects will provide crucial new understanding into the health implications arising from the impacts of climate change and variability on; 1) the quality/quantity of food, 2) chronic exposure to increases/changes in heat and humidity and 3) changes in the distribution and incidence of a range of infectious diseases and emergence of novel pathogens. This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries to increase our knowledge of the complex linkages and pathways between the climate, environment and health to help solve complex challenges that face societies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to develop a multidisciplinary approach to developing early warning systems for infectious diseases.  As extreme weather events are increasing in frequency, duration, and intensity, countries especially in the Asia Pacific Region experience elevated rates of diarrheal disease morbidity and mortality, with more than 873,000 deaths/year reported in South Asia alone. Early warning systems to address infectious disease threats are of considerable interest within the public health community as this approach resonates with the principle of disease prevention, a core underpinning of public health.  Public health practitioners require early warning systems on time scales needed to provide adequate time to prepare for and respond to projected conditions.  Weather-based warnings are too short for public health professionals and communities to plan for the threats; and climate projection-based warnings are too distant in the future; therefore, this project will focus on seasonal to sub-seasonal time scales.  The project will engage with researchers, NGOâ€™s governmental, and community organizations from the Asia Pacific Region, including Taiwan, India, China, Vietnam, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Indonesia to undertake comparative analyses of diarrheal disease risk associated with extreme weather events.  The goal is to develop a transferable, seasonal to sub-seasonal early warning system that can be implemented across the Asia Pacific Region to reduce extreme weather-related diarrheal disease burdens and improve community resilience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
