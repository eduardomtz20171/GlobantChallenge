<AbstractNarration>Many of the microorganisms on Earth live in environments without access to sunlight and therefore lack the energy from light to power chemical reactions like photosynthesis.  These bacteria live on other types of chemical reactions that use rocks and water instead of light and produce compounds that microorganisms can live on, like hydrogen, methane, or hydrogen sulfide.  One of these interactions, known as serpentinization, occurs principally in the deep sea associated with volcanic activity and mid-ocean rifts, and it can support specialized microbial life. Many questions remain however about specific chemical reactions, diversity of the microbes and metabolic activities, and how the microbes survive in these extreme environments. This project will characterize a natural spring in Northern California, Ney’s spring, which is similar to marine serpentinzing systems, making it uniquely accessible for investigation and allows the use of monitoring techniques not possible in deep marine systems.  Experiments and measurements will be made in the spring and the laboratory to examine microbial activity and chemical environment including microscale profiling.  Laboratory cultures of microbes from the spring and spring muds will be established to understand microbial processes.  Cultivations of microbes from this environment could result in the isolation of novel bacteria and applied biotechnology. The research team will implement outreach and learning activities in local schools and community colleges that benefit a diverse group of young STEM participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will approach the overarching goal of understanding microbially-mediated chemical processes that support life in this unique, ‘marine-like’ terrestrial spring by characterizing the microbial and chemical makeup of this spring, with a focus on analyses that support evidence of microbial activities that are thought to support life (utilizing inorganic compounds such as sulfide and methane). A series of field based, and lab-based experiments to support predictions of microbial activities will be performed. Cutting edge electrochemical techniques, including microelectrode profiling of spring’s chemistry, and in situ electrochemical incubations used to test for microbes that can utilize solid phase mineral as energy sources, will be used. Confirmation of microbial activities will be conducted by obtaining isolated cultivars. Significant intellectual merit will therefore be achieved by producing the first cohesive insight into the activity of microbial communities in this ‘marine-like’ spring of unique chemistry. This work will also help develop new experimental approaches in the field through the implementation of novel and cutting-edge experimentation and analytical approaches. Cultivations of microbes form this environment, also has the potential to support development of applied biotechnology. The unique, cross-discipline nature of this work will also allow the Co-Is to implement outreach and learning activities in local schools and community colleges that benefit a diverse group of young STEM participants.  This project supports two early career female investigators and significantly enhances their new research groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Chemical reactions driven by geology, for example the water-rock interaction known as serpentinization, have been shown to support microbial life in several environments including the subsurface. However, many questions remain about how life exists under serpentinizing conditions including: what specific chemical species support life&rsquo;s processes, how diverse are the types of microbial activities (or metabolisms) that operate in these environments, and how do the endemic microbes deal with the chemical stresses that result from living in a water-rock driven ecosystem. In this work, we leverage studying a natural serpentinizing spring in Northern California, Ney&rsquo;s spring, which is chemically and microbially similar to marine serpentinzing systems. This makes it unique across the known terrestrial serpentinized springs that have previously been studied, providing distinct insight into the microbial activities and physiologies that are present in these systems.</p>  <p>Our research started by geochemically and microbial characterizing the aqueous environment at Ney springs. (Reported in Trutschel <em>et al. Science of the Total Environment. </em>2022) Using water isotopes, we demonstrated that the fluids collected at Ney springs are separated from the meteoric water cycle, providing evidence that these fluids are minimally altered by either ground water or surface water (Figure 1). As such, the geochemical and microbial data observed in this work is largely influenced by the water-rock interactions. Geochemically, the site at Ney&rsquo;s is distinct from other terrestrial systems due to the high sulfide concentrations (~1 mM) and ammonia concentrations. The gas composition at Ney&rsquo;s has shifted from hydrogen (&lt;1% gas composition) to methane (&gt;80%). Based on the geochemical composition of the spring and thermodynamic calculations, we predicted that metabolisms that either used or produced methane in this environment could be present&mdash;with anaerobic methane oxidation being particularly thermodynamically favorable. However, no evidence of Archaea, or methanogenic (or anaerobic methane oxidizing) archaea were found in either the microbial community analysis or metagenome. Methane isotopes supported the potential for methane to be thermogenic in origin. Similarly, no phylogenies or genetic support for aerobic methane oxidation were observed. Metabolisms capable of simple fermentation reactions, and sulfur oxidation were observed in the metagenomes and we were later able to support these potential metabolisms through cultivation of different species, including heterotrophic sulfur-oxidizing <em>Halomonas</em> and <em>Rosinatronobacter</em> species (Figure 2).</p>  <p>Because of the ease of access to Ney springs, we were able to perform seasonal analyses of the aqueous geochemistry and microbial community (Reported in Trutschel <em>et al. Frontiers in Microbiology,</em> 2022). Though many taxa were often observed at Ney springs (occasionally &gt; 5,000 ASVs), only 96 ASVs were observed consistently at every sampling trip. Of these 96 resident ASVs only 16 were observed in abundance of 1% of the total community. We were able to obtain high quality metagenomes assembled genomes of these 16 core taxa and investigate correlations between their seasonal abundance and site geochemistry (Figure 3). For example, <em>Tindalia</em> sp., which were consistently the most abundant ASVs at the site, were strongly correlated with ammonia levels in the spring (Figure 3F). Genomically these organisms were shown to be capable of amino acid fermentation reactions that could generate ammonia as a byproduct. As such, we hypothesize that fluctuations in ammonia levels observed at Ney springs are driven by the activities of this group which is important because ammonia is a potentially potent inhibitor of various microbial activities.</p>  <p>The origin of sulfide, and its potential to support microbial activities have remained an outstanding question at Ney springs. Minimal evidence for biological generation of sulfide (through sulfate reduction) was observed in the genetic/metagenomic data from the site. Our attempts to culture organisms capable of sulfate/sulfur reduction were unsuccessful (data not shown). To further investigate the potential for sulfate reduction we investigated sulfide and sulfate isotopes from Ney springs. The similarity in isotope values (&delta;<sup>34</sup>S<sub>VCDT</sub> 14.34 vs 16.67 &amp; &Delta;<sup>33</sup>S or 0.024 and 0.056 for Zn-S and Sulfate [Thode] samples respectively) suggest that there is little evidence of biological sulfate reduction in this system, but some potential for sulfur oxidation. As mentioned previously, sulfur oxidation was supported by our genetic/metagenomic investigations and is present in three of the 16 core ASVs consistently abundant at Ney springs.</p>  <p>The major findings of this work support a dynamic community is supported at Ney springs that is largely the result of water-rock interactions. We were able to successfully link various metabolic activities to important taxonomic groups, providing insight into how microbes are surviving in these environments. Notably we see evidence for some of the metabolisms we predicted would thrive in this ecosystem (i.e., sulfur oxidation) and not others (i.e., methanogenesis, methane oxidation) and this might be due to the presence of other stressors (i.e., ammonia) or the extreme pH of this system (&gt; pH 12). Our future work will focus on understanding how the microbes we cultured from this environment, including notably the autotrophic <em>Thiomicrospira</em>.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 12/31/2024<br> Modified by: Annette&nbsp;R&nbsp;Rowe</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2025687/2025687_10686873_1735676377972_fmicb_14_1182497_g002--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2025687/2025687_10686873_1735676377972_fmicb_14_1182497_g002--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2025687/2025687_10686873_1735676377972_fmicb_14_1182497_g002--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Water isotope plot showing Ney Springs cistern samples collected seasonally compared to surface water proximal springs, Ney Springs Creek, snow melt, and the global meteoric water line.
