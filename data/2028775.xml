<AbstractNarration>Between 1951 and 1962, the U.S. Department of Energy detonated one hundred nuclear weapons during above-ground testing at the Nevada Test Site (NTS), near Las Vegas. The resulting fallout deposited radioactivity across much of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. Together with hundreds more tests around the world, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, as well as the 1986 and 2011 accidents at Chernobyl and Fukushima Daiichi power plants, it is clear that the atomic age has increased radioactive exposure for human and non-human organisms around the globe. In the short term, radiation exposure raises rates of genetic change (i.e., mutation) and negatively affects survival and reproduction for most organisms tested. In the long term, however, the evolutionary impacts of radiation exposure are not yet clear. Do mutation rates stay elevated over time? Do populations adapt to withstand radiation exposure? Do survival and reproduction stay depressed or recover? Answers to these questions are directly relevant to the long term health of human and non-human populations near places like Fukushima and Chernobyl. They are more broadly relevant to long-standing questions about how mutation rate and natural selection interact during adaptation. Several undergraduates and two graduate students will be trained in diverse laboratory and bioinformatic analyses, including members of underrepresented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project asks: how have wild populations evolved following radiation exposure? This is a difficult question to answer because science is often missing baseline, pre-radiation population data. Moreover, for many organisms, only a few generations have passed since irradiation. This project overcomes both of these problems using an organism with short generation times and an approach called resurrection ecology. Resurrection ecology is the collection of historical population samples in the form of dormant eggs that have been deposited through time in sediments. In particular, this research focuses on dormant eggs of small, freshwater crustaceans in the genus Daphnia. Daphnia create annual egg deposits that spend the winter on lake bottoms before hatching in the spring. Some of these eggs do not hatch, however, because they are buried by sediment. This study will take sediment cores from lakes inside and out of the NTS radioactive fallout zone to collect dormant Daphnia eggs deposited before, during, and after above ground nuclear testing. The researchers will hatch eggs from those eras and raise offspring in laboratory conditions to measure rates of hatching, survival, and reproduction. If radiation exposure negatively impacted these populations, then researchers expect that populations from sediments deposited during and shortly after nuclear testing will have relatively low rates of survival and reproduction. If populations adapt to radiation exposure over time, the researchers predict that more recent resurrections will have higher rates of survival and reproduction, on par with pre-nuclear populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supported two main projects over four years. The first project tested whether ionizing radiation from nuclear fallout from weapons testing could drive population evolution. Our study organism was the water flea, genus <em>Daphnia</em>, in three alpine lakes in Utah. These lakes were downwind of the Nevada Test Site and received nuclear fallout in the 1950s and &lsquo;60s. We focused on <em>Daphnia</em> because they generate eggs each season that overwinter before starting the next generation. However, some of those eggs are covered by sediments and remain dormant. Each year generates a layer of eggs, and these layers stack over time. We used sediment cores sample sediment stacks to isolate &gt;4700 eggs from times before, during, and after the nuclear testing era. We then attempted to hatch these eggs to measure hatch rate, survivorship, and reproductive capability, hypothesizing that eggs that received fallout would be reduced in these metrics. However, we were only able to hatch a single egg and could not complete the experiment.</p> <p>The second project aimed to reconstruct the evolutionary history of two threespine stickleback fish species in Enos Lake, Vancouver Island. We took a sediment core from Enos Lake that reached back to the last ice age, when the lake formed. Our aim was to isolate DNA from the sediment, reconstructing the population genetic history of stickleback in this lake. With sequence data, wished to ask when the lake was initially colonized by stickleback; how it evolved its two species; and how the species pair collapsed into a single species when an invasive crayfish was introduced to the lake. We sampled sediments from along this core and searched the sediment for stickleback bones to sequence, finding none. Then we extracted DNA from the sediments and used modern metagenomic and capture bait techniques to produce DNA sequences. We detected plant and insect DNA in the core, but not stickleback DNA. We are currently troubleshooting and applying new techniques to isolate stickleback DNA.</p> <p>INTELLECTUAL MERIT</p> <p>Despite its null result, the first project advanced knowledge on several fronts. First, we used radioisotope dating methods to date the sediment cores and have made the dating profiles and sedimentation rate data publicly-available. These will be useful for reconstruction of lake history by geologists and biologists. Second, we also made available data on the stable isotope profile of these lakes, revealing novel information about the movement of energy and nutrients through these fragile, high-elevation lake ecosystems. Third, the null result is useful as a case study for the failure of &ldquo;resurrection ecology&rdquo;. Future researchers can consider why this project did not work when they design their own projects, increasing scientific effectiveness and efficiency. Despite its (so far) null result, the second project also advanced knowledge on several fronts. First, we sequenced plant and insect DNA from the sediment core, which paleoecologists will find useful to reconstruct environmental change over the past 10,000 years. This will inform our understanding of current climate change. Second, again, our null result is useful as a case study for the difficulty of sediment DNA approaches, spurring methodological improvement for future studies.</p> <p>BROADER IMPACTS</p> <p>Both projects trained a diverse group of young scientists.
