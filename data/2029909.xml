<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of high-performance filters to improve access to safe and reliable drinking water. Contaminated drinking water is a public health crisis affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide, including many across the United States. The proposed nanotechnology-enabled water filter technology provides a unique solution to pervasive drinking water pollutants, including lead and arsenic. As an in-home or point-of-use (POU) technology, it is envisioned that a product would be used at the primary faucet used for water consumption or in reusable water bottles.  The technology may be especially valuable for those relying on unregulated water supplies like private drinking water wells, where water is often consumed with little to no treatment. Institutions with older plumbing systems would benefit from these filters at their fountains and bubblers. This could positively impact communities with limited freshwater resources or needs of humanitarian missions or natural disasters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of nanotechnology-enabled water treatment devices. Electrospinning to fabricate functionalized polymer-metal oxide nanofiber composites for drinking water treatment coupling physical and chemical removal routes for a diverse range of pollutants has been shown. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this work is to translate nanofiber fabrication recipes to industrial scale and demonstrate the performance of the functionalized polymer nanocomposites using a prototype point-of-use (POU) water treatment device (e.g., for use at the tap, within a home refrigerator or a reusable water bottle). Development efforts include scaling up electrospinning processes to fabricate nanofiber membrane sheets of dimensions necessary for integration into POU treatment devices; integration of these nanofiber membrane sheets into prototype POU treatment platforms to demonstrate ease of installation, use and maintenance; and validation of the device for regulatory approval of removal of lead (Pb) and arsenic (As). The transformative aspect of this technology is to create multi-functional, nanostructured materials with synergistic performance characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
