<AbstractNarration>Scalable and agile approaches are needed to inspire young learners to develop STEM and computer science literacies and increase interest in STEM and computer science careers. However, advancing STEM and computer science skills is particularly challenging in elementary schools where teachers often teach subjects outside of their preparation, have limited technology support, and limited computer science curricular resources. In rural areas, geographical isolation and poverty further exacerbate existing barriers, and students with disabilities struggle significantly more than their peers in STEM disciplines. As a result, opportunities to develop computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) skills for these students are fundamentally inequitable. This Research Practitioner Partnership project is aimed at making data science education accessible to rural, elementary students, including students with high-incidence disabilities (e.g., learning disabilities, emotional/behavioral disorders), to increase participation in CS education and broaden ways to hone CT skills. The project team will accomplish this through collaborative work between Clemson University researchers and 4th-5th grade teachers from a rural school district. The researchers and teachers will work together to develop, implement and test a model for creating and sustaining a customizable learning module that focuses on developing CT skills within a STEM context. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team will take a Design-Based Implementation Research approach to the project, where they will iteratively co-design curricular resources and conduct research to inform revisions to the curriculum. They will also use a “Pop-up” approach to address the need for scalable and agile data science curriculum modules. In education, Pop-ups are often understood as customizable courses or units that vary in length and are implemented at various times based on student needs; they are often best suited to teaching a new skill or technology. In this project, the Pop-up modules will be designed to (1) provide local contextualized problems and issues; (2) align to South Carolina’s Computer Science and Digital Literacy Standards; (3) map to a research-based taxonomy of  CT practices for mathematics and science classrooms (Weintrop et al., 2016); and (4) appeal to young rural learners, including those with disabilities. The team will use Connected Learning Theory and the Universal Design for Learning framework to guide the curriculum development work. Through a concurrent parallel mixed-methods approach, they will investigate the key features of the co-design curriculum process, teachers’ successes and challenges during iterative implementation cycles of the data science curriculum, the impact of the project and curriculum on teachers’ confidence, self-efficacy and interest, the impact of the curriculum on elementary students’ data and computational problem-solving practices, whether the impact is different for student with and without disabilities, and the impact on students’ confidence, self-efficacy and interest in data science. The project team will share a model that they develop with researchers and practitioners across the United States to improve STEM learning for students who historically have been at a disadvantage in terms of access and resources. The data science modules that the teachers co-create will be available online for teachers across the country to download and customize.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded by the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF-funded project, <em>Inclusive Data Science Education for Rural Elementary Students: A Research Practice Partnership for Agile Learning,</em> was aimed at increasing participation in STEM education through developing and implementing computational data science units in rural elementary classrooms. Over four years our research team engaged in a research-practice partnership (RPP) with a rural elementary school in South Carolina to co-create, with teachers, elementary-level data science curriculum that was customized based on the context and needs of the school community. Our work together focused on providing relevant data science units to underserved (rural, special education) students. As such, our team researched data science curricula development with more than 30 rural elementary teachers, including two virtual teachers, and 600 students in their classrooms. We hosted in-person week-long workshops for two summers that were focused helping teachers use Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to co-create interest-based computational data science units for their students. Working with our educational partners, we were able to provide learning opportunities responsive to the needs of rural schools, the participating teachers and their students.&nbsp;During this project, we helped teachers align the data science units to topics the students cared about, requisite educational standards and everyday classroom instruction, while embedding computational thinking skills in the learning activities. We also learned about the important assets that rural teachers, their students, and families contribute to developing engaging instruction and learning with data science.</p> <p>&nbsp;We investigated &ldquo;How can data science curricula be effectively designed, customized and integrated into inclusive, rural elementary classroom instruction to advance CT learning?&rdquo; Our research plan focused on the impact of the data science curricula on both teachers and their students by examining ways elementary teachers and researchers co-designed a data science curriculum aligned with student interest and STEM practices. We examined elementary teachers&rsquo; successes and challenges during iterative implementation cycles of the data science curriculum, and we explored how they used UDL in their instructional practices. Using surveys, we measured and found significant increases in elementary teachers' confidence, self-efficacy, and interest in teaching data science through the co-design and implementation of data science curricula. Similarly, we found that the data science curricula impacted elementary students' data and computational problem-solving practices and confidence in using data science. This increase was also notable in students with disabilities. Teachers consistently used UDL to plan and implement the data science units in their classrooms, and their approach towards integrating both CT and UDL increased in the second year of data science unit implementations after they developed a strong community of practice to support expanding and improving on their instructional strategies.</p> <p>&nbsp;There were several key outcomes from this project. The project advanced knowledge of how to co-create interest-based data science units for elementary-aged students and resulted in the creation of a teacher and student-friendly data science instructional framework to guide curricular design. &nbsp;Our research team also developed a novel data visualization tool, Groova, to assist elementary teachers and students in analyzing and visualizing data in order to tell data stories. Groova was developed based on teacher&rsquo;s desire for a free, developmentally appropriate tool for young children, and revised with teacher input in the third year of the project. &nbsp;An important key outcome of this project was the generation of more than more than 20 data science instructional units developed by K-5 teachers, with exemplars available on our project website datapopups.com. Teachers also developed and identified associated resources such as instructional presentations, curated data sets, and engaged students with STEM experts in their local community who use data in their everyday work. The grant resulted in six published journal articles and eight conference presentations to date.</p> <p>This projects engaged more than 600 underserved youth (rural youth, students of color, students with disabilities), their teachers and some community members in data science and CT,&nbsp; which may lead to early pathways towards STEM careers, broadening participation in STEM. &nbsp;We provided mentoring and hands-on experience for six interdisciplinary (Learning Sciences, Special Education, Teacher Education) graduate students working on the project over four years; these graduate students may influence the next generation of educational researchers interested in data science, rural populations, and students with disabilities. The curriculum and associated resources that are available on our website, datapopups.com, and our free data visualization tool for early elementary students, Groova (available at Groovadata.com). An unexpected outcome was the continuation and expansion of the data science PD and implementation by instructional coaches at the school to other teachers and grade levels after our research team stepped back. We served as off-site guides versus facilitators, and the units were extended to grades K-1.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 10/07/2024<br> Modified by: Danielle&nbsp;Herro</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2031175/2031175_10693192_1728331526934_Data_Science_Instructional_Framework--rgov-214x142.png" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2031175/2031175_10693192_1728331526934_Data_Science_Instructional_Framework--rgov-800width.png" title="Data Science Instructional Framework"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2031175/2031175_10693192_1728331526934_Data_Science_Instructional_Framework--rgov-66x44.png" alt="Data Science Instructional Framework"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Teacher-friendly Framework to Guide Curriculum Development</div> <div class="imageCredit">Image courtesy of research team from Clemson University and University of Georgia</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Danielle&nbsp;Herro <div class="imageTitle">Data Science Instructional Framework</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2031175/2031175_10693192_1728331893543_Groova--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2031175/2031175_10693192_1728331893543_Groova--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Screenshot from Groova"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2031175/2031175_10693192_1728331893543_Groova--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Screenshot from Groova"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Data Visualization Tool Developed for K-5 Student Use</div> <div class="imageCredit">Golnaz Arastoopour Irgens</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Danielle&nbsp;Herro <div class="imageTitle">Screenshot from Groova</div> </div> </li></ul> </div> </div></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
