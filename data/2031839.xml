<AbstractNarration>For nearly four decades, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has played a leadership role in provisioning advanced cyberinfrastructure capabilities for the Nation's Science and Engineering (S&amp;E) researchers. An important component in this investment is the leadership-class computing program that provides computational and data analytics capabilities at the largest scale to inspire transformative S&amp;E discoveries that would not be possible otherwise. NSF's current leadership-class computing investment supports Frontera, the largest High-Performance Computing (HPC) system on a US academic campus. The Frontera system is deployed and operated by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at the University of Texas (UT) at Austin. This travel grant will support the participation of researchers who have been awarded a computer time allocation on the Frontera system at a future Principal Investigator (PI) meeting organized by TACC. The award will also support travel for technical coordination between researchers and the Frontera project to ensure optimal and effective utilization of the Frontera system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the PI meeting is to allow Frontera research users, as well as their students, to share scientific results, exchange practical lessons-learned, and present their overall experience from using the Frontera system. In addition to research presentations, the meeting will have ample time, as well as facilitated sessions, to promote increased interaction between Frontera research users and project staff. The outcome of the PI meeting will not only enable the Frontera project to better understand and serve the scientific research community, but also build a community to better represent the unique needs of S&amp;E research that require access to NSF leadership computing facilities. To facilitate deeper coordination beyond the PI meeting, this award will also provide travel support to enable technical coordination between the research user teams and the Frontera project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The project was a travel grant to support development of leadership-class computing facility (LCCF) computational science codes applicable to fluid dynamics in general and hypersonics in particular. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted all travel until late 2022 such that the PI could make one trip to the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) for the 2022 Frontera Users' Group Meeting in August 4-5, 2022.      An outcome of that visit was an invitation by TACC to the PI submit a "Characteristic Science Application" proposal for helping define the needs of Horizon, the post-Frontera LCCF. The PI's CSA proposal was selected in 2022 so that the PI and TACC are collaborating to ensure that Horizon achieves its stated "10x the Science of Frontera" goal.      The abstract from the CSA report titled "Hypersonics on Horizon--Path to 10x the Science Beyond Frontera"The science and engineering of very high speed gases flowing adjacent to natural and engineered bodies is characterized by the presence of strong shock waves, high pressures, and extreme temperatures that initiate chemical, thermal, and electronic non-equilibrium. Our proposed CSA science problem targets the specific interaction of a hypersonic flow with an aerodynamically-shaped body made of an ablating material. The multiphysics simulation of the fluid--material interaction will be conducted using two leadership-class codes---PC2 for the fluid dynamics and CHyPS for the material response---that were written by the PI and his team. These codes utilize leading-edge numerical methods implemented in C++, use OpenMP and MPI for hybrid parallelization, use OpenMP offloading and accelerator-specific backends, and are leading examplars of computational science in their respective fields. Through careful baseline performance analysis, we measured the codes' current strong scaling parallel performance, memory performance, vectorization, computational intensity, roofline performance, and load balance. Several concurrent paths are proposed to accelerate the codes to achieve more than 10x the science on Horizon. These paths combine novel algorithmic developments to address timescale disparity with detailed code analysis to improve vectorization and computational intensity, reduce memory accesses, and improve load balance. Improvements in offloading, operator assembly and data streaming will further enable the codes to fully leverage the Grace Hopper chipsets without code specialization and loss of CPU utilization. Our most likely end-to-end science acceleration is 15x over current Frontera performance.     Last Modified: 03/03/2024       Submitted by: DanielJBodony]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
