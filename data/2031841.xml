<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Social-interaction restrictions have to be respected to contain the spread of highly contagious diseases such as COVID-19. Ensuring compliance to strict health interventions, however, needs better understanding of individual decisions under risk. Until a vaccine is developed, policy makers not only need to find the best incentives for people to avoid physical proximity, but they also need to create plans for relaxing social distancing in the near future. Behavioral forecasts from the models developed in this project help to guide decisions in both cases. Specifically, this project provides answers to several policy-relevant questions such as: What changes in social behavior are people adopting in response to the disruptions created by the COVID-19 outbreak? Who is more likely to respect health guidelines, including social distancing protocols? What are safety/risk perceptions of physical proximity in public spaces (pharmacies, grocery stores, take-outs at restaurants) and how are these perceptions shaping daily choices? How to create incentives for individuals to sustain social-distancing? How are COVID-19 disruptions causing losses in individual welfare, and how can analysts derive metrics to value such losses? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the research team adopts and significantly adapts crowding research tools and methods in retail and transportation studies to analyze social distancing behaviors as preventive action against threats to health. An innovate virtual-reality-based online survey with choice experiments on social distancing collects time-sensitive behavioral data. The data are modeled using micro-econometric discrete-continuous choice models with structural equations for attitudinal components and heavy-tailed error distributions for preference shocks. Unlike standard thin-tailed distributions, error terms that exhibit heavy tails not only generalize standard assumptions but also address decision-uncertainty behavior. Flexible decision rules under risk are integrated into the discrete-continuous choice models that represent time-use scheduling during total and partial lock-downs. Ultimately, research outcomes from this study provide guidance to policy-makers for how to best implement measures such as social distancing and quarantines in order to control major epidemics, and then how to best phase out these measures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

The findings highlighted the complex interplay of factors such as vaccination rates, COVID-19 cases, and public attitudes, revealing evidence of free-riding behavior and the influence of perceived vulnerability to diseases. Because of the dynamic data collection effort, it was possible to control for evolving pandemic conditions such as the number of COVID-19 active cases, vaccination uptake, and the frequency of Google searches related to the vaccines. It was found that the rate of vaccinated individuals in the population actually increased the probability of vaccine hesitancy, and therefore discouraged people from getting vaccinated (free-riding behavior). The number of COVID-19 cases had a positive effect on the probability of getting vaccinated, suggesting that individuals reacted to the pandemic conditions by taking protective measures. Google trend data did not seem to have a straightforward effect on vaccination demand, but it increased consumers&rsquo; economic valuation of several vaccine characteristics. Overall, results of the full data analysis were consistent with the outcomes of a study published in the Journal of Choice Modelling, where a new statistical model for the degree of interaction of factors affecting choices was used to analyze a single wave of the panel (Daziano and Krueger, 2022). This latter study identified effectiveness as the most crucial vaccine attribute, followed by the risk of severe side effects and the duration of protection. Notably, the interactions among non-pecuniary vaccine attributes were found to be synergistic. Out-of-pocket costs, while independent of effectiveness, incubation period, and mild side effects, exhibited moderate synergistic interactions with other attributes. Furthermore, the research indicated that vaccine adoption was notably higher among individuals identifying as male, those with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree or higher education, individuals from households with high incomes, supporters of the democratic party, those who had experienced COVID-19, individuals who received the flu vaccine in winter 2020/21, and those with underlying health conditions.</p> <p>The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted people&rsquo;s lives and businesses, including grocery stores.

Some customers migrated to online shopping to avoid queues and crowded spaces, but switching to online shopping is simply not possible for many individuals. Published in the Journal of Choice Modelling, Budzinski and Daziano (2022) investigated New York City residents&rsquo; preferences for online grocery shopping at the onset of the pandemic. The study identified three market segments and assessed consumers&rsquo; willingness to pay for various attributes, focusing on the quality of stock, delivery characteristics, and the cost of the online order. Consumers in each segment were characterized by their observed traits and fear-related attitudes.
