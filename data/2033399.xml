<AbstractNarration>Airborne noise mitigation is a significant challenge in several engineering applications, particularly in the aerospace realm where it diminishes efficiency, hampers stealth, contributes to environmental pollution and curtails commercial viability. Conventional technologies have reached practical limits in addressing airborne noise, especially for low-frequency (&lt;~1000 Hz) spectra. In partnership with NASA’s Langley Research Center, Thermo-Acoustic Meta-Structures (TAMS), a new class of multifunctional structures will be explored with a focus on mitigating aircraft turbofan engine’s core-noise. A confluence of innovative multi-physical mechanisms within a novel design framework termed ‘assonance’ will be investigated to enrich broadband, low-frequency performance for TAMS. It is expected that new insights will be gained into underlying phenomena enabling the development of modeling tools to create prototype TAMS for evaluation in NASA’s facilities. Successful completion of this project will deliver a new technology for airborne noise mitigation, enhancing critical mission capabilities in several military and commercial engineering applications. This project has substantial congruence with the economic vision and strengths of the regional industrial and educational ecosystem of the State of Oklahoma while also contributing to national aerospace and defense interests and directly enabling technological solutions for sustainable global aviation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of this project is to educe new insights into scaling laws and structure-performance relationships for Thermo-Acoustic Meta-Structures (TAMS) aiding the development of impactful solutions for multifunctional applications, especially in the aerospace realm. Specifically, opportunities to address the aircraft turbofan engine core-noise mitigation priorities of NASA will be explored. Core-noise has significant low-frequency (&lt;~1000 Hz) components, as yet unaddressed using conventional acoustic liners. Utilizing available thermal gradients across the engine’s core-wall, a confluence of innovative designs for structural materials and interactive multiphysical mechanisms thereof will be employed to embed thermoacoustic elements into liner meta-structures. A new, computationally-efficient modeling tool based on a mulitphysical model for TAMS embedding the Rott’s model for thermoacoustics in conjunction with vibroacoustic elements within NASA’s Zwikker-Kosten Transmission Line (ZKTL) model for acoustic liners is proposed to be developed. An emergent metamaterials-inspired design framework termed ‘assonance’ will be explored to enrich broadband performance for TAMS. In partnership with NASA, state-of-the-art structural material configurations and fabrication processes will be utilized to construct prototypical test articles for evaluation using NASA’s experimental facilities. Generation of extensive data sets under varying acoustic conditions will help validate the model, extract scaling laws for power-to-volume ratio, influence of radiation impedance and frequency-thermal gradient dependencies and establish new insights into structure-performance relationships for assonant meta-structures. Successful completion of this project will deliver a new technology for airborne noise mitigation, enhancing critical mission capabilities in several military and commercial engineering applications and directly contributing to sustainable global aviation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Airborne noise mitigation is a significant challenge in several engineering applications, particularly in the aerospace realm where it diminishes efficiency, hampers stealth, contributes to environmental pollution and curtails commercial viability. Conventional technologies have reached practical limits in addressing airborne noise, especially for low-frequency (&lt;~1000 Hz) spectra. In collaboration with NASA&rsquo;s Langley Research Center, Thermo-Acoustic Meta-Structures (TAMS), a new class of multifunctional structures was explored with a primary focus on mitigating aircraft turbofan engine&rsquo;s core-noise. New capabilities were developed at Oklahoma State University to test additively manufactured porous stacks that displayed performance commensurate with ceramic stacks. The influence of sound pressure level and frequency as well as stack length and position on the performance of a thermoacoustic liner is investigated using normal incidence impedance tube tests and DeltaEC simulations. Using Rott&rsquo;s approximation, the stack&rsquo;s pore width and wall thickness are optimized for additively manufactured thermoacoustic liner test articles. A peak steady-state temperature gradient of 9.5 &deg;C is obtained at 790 Hz for 140 dB tonal dwells. It is found that the temperature gradient correlates directly with the acoustic power available at the leading stack-face, which is highest when the stack is near the center of the resonator. In contrast, acoustic absorption diminishes when the stack is nearer to the closed-end of the resonator. At higher excitation pressure levels, the contribution of viscous heating to the deviation in the thermoacoustic gradient becomes significant. The relationship between the acoustic absorption and the thermoacoustic temperature gradient was also examined. In application scenarios requiring multifunctional optimization, a tradeoff may be required in terms of the absorption in order to maximize the temperature gradient. Using simulations verified by experiments, the interdependence between the thermoacoustic temperature gradient and the acoustic absorption coefficient for a host of parametric variations was established. The influence of flow speed on the performance of folded-core thermoacoustic liners was shown to involve energy transfer due to convective cooling, which impedes the thermoacoustic energy conversion process at high flow speeds. Further, an acoustic-thermoelectric transduction scheme was then employed to harvest usable electrical power using the best-performing stack, resulting in a peak voltage of 33 mV at an output power of 19.8 &mu;W. Using the large dataset that was obtained from experiments conducted at NASA Langley, optimized designs for metamaterials-inspired thermoacoustic liner prototypes are being developed and evaluated. With current additive and hybrid fabrication processes and materials reaching commercial maturity, opportunities exist to realize thermoacoustic liners with enriched functionalities. Broader impacts of this project promoted student training and professional development especially at the undergraduate level. An experiential lab module on thermoacoustics was included in the honors project for students in a sophomore level course taught by the PI. Graduate students gave presentations to the class on summer research at NASA Langley and on opportunities for undergraduates at NASA. NASA collaborators visited OSU to interact with students and give a seminar on acoustic liners. In addition to journal and conference publications, this project has also resulted in a patent application, a finalist entry in a business plan competition, and a press article.</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 05/16/2024<br> Modified by: James&nbsp;Manimala</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
