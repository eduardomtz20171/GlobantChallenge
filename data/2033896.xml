<AbstractNarration>Each year in the United States, approximately 70,000 new adults on the autism spectrum will seek employment.  At the same time, employers in technology, finance, healthcare, and many other critical job sectors seek highly skilled and highly trained individuals to fill specialized positions. With support from the DRK-12 Program in the Division of Research on Learning and the NSF 2026 Fund Program in the Office of Integrated Activities, this research will investigate new tools and methods for matching individual job-seekers on the autism spectrum to employment opportunities that leverage their unique cognitive skills, with a focus on visuospatial cognitive skills.  Numerous jobs require strong visuospatial cognitive skills, such as visual inspection and quality control, process monitoring, document review, surveillance, software testing, and data visualization, to name a few.  Many people on the autism spectrum show strengths in visuospatial cognitive skills, but these strengths are not fully understood, including how they differ from person to person and how they map onto workplace-relevant capabilities.  Understanding visuospatial cognitive skills in individuals on the autism spectrum or other neurodiverse conditions has high potential impact for enhancing the neurodiversity of the workforce by enabling more effective programs for the recruitment, selection, and retention of such candidates in the public and private sectors.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This NSF2026 EAGER project enriches the NSF2026 Idea Machine winning entry Harnessing the Human Diversity of Mind. It seeks to develop and evaluate integrated, AI-enabled technologies for measuring a personâ€™s visuospatial cognitive skills in new ways and then using these measurements to predict performance on workplace-relevant tasks.  The research conducted during this two-year project will include conducting a large pilot study with individuals on the autism spectrum and neurotypical individuals, in which participants will be given several visuospatial tests, and detailed data about their actions will be recorded using sensors such as eye trackers and cameras. Then, data mining and machine learning techniques will be used to extract meaningful patterns from these rich streams of behavioral data, and analyses will be conducted to examine how these patterns in foundational behaviors map onto individual skills and interests in realistic, workplace-relevant activities.  This research will also gather and analyze detailed feedback from industry partners to identify specific job types and sectors that would benefit from recruiting employees who are strong in visuospatial cognitive skills.  In addition, this project will involve neurodiverse students and staff in many of its activities, in particular by involving graduate trainees supported by the NSF Research Traineeship in Neurodiversity Inspired Science &amp; Engineering (NISE) and by leveraging the skills of neurodiverse interns at the Frist Center for Autism &amp; Innovation at Vanderbilt University's School of Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  In this project, we designed and developed a new method for measuring a persons visuospatial cognitive abilities. In particular, we created a new online cognitive assessment platform that we call the Web-Based Online Measurement of Block Arrangements Tasks (WOMBAT) system. Block arrangement tasks are like puzzle tasks in which a person has to arrange colored blocks to copy a visual design.      The WOMBAT provides an innovative method of cognitive assessment that collects data not just on how well a person can complete these tasks, but also how they do it, including what kind of problem-solving strategies a person might come up with, and what kinds of mistakes they might make. Using this WOMBAT system, researchers can now collect data from large numbers of people online in order to better understand how visuospatial cognition differs across individuals and groups.      We pilot-tested WOMBAT in a sample of 80 participants, including 40 neurotypical adults and 40 adults who self-reported being on the autism spectrum. Based on results from this pilot study, we designed and implemented several refinements to the WOMBAT system to make it easier for people to understand the task, and also to make it easier for researchers to interpret the resulting data.      Through a collaborative project, we will be using WOMBAT to study how visuospatial cognition relates to different aspects of a persons employment. These WOMBAT studies will include neurotypical adults and adults on the autism spectrum. We expect that results from these studies will help advance our scientific understanding of how different people with different patterns of visuospatial cognitive strengths can be individually supported in various career pathways. We also expect that WOMBAT will open up many other innovative avenues of research, for instance to look at how visuospatial abilities develop in different people during childhood, how visuospatial abilities impact student learning in high school and college, and more.      In addition to these broader impacts for science and society, additional broader impacts of this project included providing interdisciplinary research training across AI and cognitive science for many students, including at high school, undergraduate, PhD, and postdoctoral levels, and also including several neurodivergent students (i.e., students on the autism spectrum or with other cognitive differences like ADHD and dyslexia).
