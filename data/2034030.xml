<AbstractNarration>The Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program (HSI Program) supports RAPID projects when there is severe urgency with regard to availability of, or access to, data, facilities or specialized equipment, including quick-response research on natural or anthropogenic disasters and similar unanticipated events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This project aims to develop effective virtual internships and undergraduate research experiences to expand learning and professional development opportunities in computer sciences to minoritized undergraduate students. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a disruption in society across all sectors with widespread loss of internships, jobs, and undergraduate research experiences that negatively impact the talent pipeline in computing fields and the future of U.S. innovation. Such disruptions are likely to occur in the near future, and the U.S. must be well-prepared in offering effective virtual development opportunities and experiences for students. This project will address this exigency by refining a proven model for developing professional, research, team, and communication skills so that it will be effective in a virtual environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will engage students from diverse backgrounds and with diverse experiences in impactful research projects while proving students funding that will, in part, support continuation of their education. Broadening participation of minoritized students in research can increase retention and graduation rates in computing fields.  The proposed project will provide faculty professional development in the Affinity Research Group (ARG) model, a Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) signature and proven practice for immersing students in research. Faculty will also learn how to incorporate ARG elements into classroom pedagogical practice to improve teaching and learning. The effort will lead to a national community of faculty who are skilled at undergraduate research mentoring informed by the ARG model and who grow through their involvement with a cohort of researchers and participation in ARG interactive webinars. The evaluation will identify the practices that work best for the virtual Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs). It will also examine whether student perceptions of computer science and their career goals change after participation in a virtual REU. In addition, the evaluation will investigate the benefit to faculty of joining a cohort community in support of research with undergraduate.  The development of a model for effective virtual undergraduate research experiences can benefit many students, especially students who do not have the ability to travel to remote REUs because of family obligations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award is made by the Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program in the Division of Human Resource Development, Directorate of Education and Human Resources. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The benefits of research experiences for undergraduate students (REUs) have been well documented. Students are exposed to and engage in authentic research procedures, expand their knowledge of a research area, and learn how to solve problems using real-world examples. An REU positively influences students' motivation to persist to degree completion, deepens their interest in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM ), exposes them to new STEM opportunities, builds their self-efficacy and self-confidence, and improves their scientific and communication skills levels. Foremost, REUs are critical for a pathway to graduate studies and entry into a competitive workforce. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a disruption in society across all sectors with widespread loss of internships, jobs, and undergraduate research experiences that had the potential to negatively impact the talent pipeline in computing fields and the future of U.S. innovation.    The Computing Alliance of Hispanic Serving Institutions (CAHSI), a national consortium of 60 institutions at the time, established a virtual Research Experience for Undergraduates initiative to ensure that academically talented undergraduate students had the opportunity to engage in research experiences. The investigators adapted the Affinity Research Group (ARG), a proven model for developing professional, research, team, and communication skills, to be effective in a virtual environment, forming the basis for the virtual REU initiative.    The virtual REU framework includes: 1) weekly half-hour meetings for faculty mentors to learn and apply the ARG model to assist them in putting into practice activities that deliberately develop students' skills; 2) development of research plans co-created by the faculty mentor and student; 3) student requirements to maintain a research journal that captures their weekly accomplishments and challenges; 4) periodic opportunities for faculty mentors to reflect on their REU experiences and consider effective practices shared by their peers; and 5) preparation, constructive critique, and refinement of students' research posters.    The benefits of the virtual REU framework are the ability to: provide research opportunities for students with financial need and family obligations that prevent them from attending remote REUs; increase participation in undergraduate research experiences by cutting down on commute time and making time and place flexible for faculty and students; ensure that faculty are not isolated in their work with students by providing a supportive community of peers to consult on solutions to challenges, share ideas, and provide insight; and, finally, provide a formal environment through weekly online meetings on the ARG model that provides structure for improving student research outcomes. In addition, the virtual REU removes the faculty burden of a residential REU that brings undergraduate students from across the U.S. into in-person, on-campus REU programs, which requires logistics, housing, and organized student cohort activities. The drawbacks of the virtual REU are the need to ship hardware in cases when specialized hardware is needed for the assigned research project; non-verbal communication cues can be lacking in a virtual environment; internet connectivity for some students and faculty mentors can be problematic; and, finally, virtual environments can make relationship-building with faculty and peers more difficult.    Evaluation of the virtual REU initiative revealed that it expands undergraduate research experiences to a broader range of students, and there is no statistical difference in student development between the face-to-face and virtual interactions with faculty. Virtual REU participants reflecting on their experiences stated that research skills, communication skills, and technical skills were the top three gains they experienced in the virtual REU program. Students also indicated they gained problem solving skills, understanding of concepts/theory behind their research, relevancy of their computing courses, understanding of the process of research, and improvement in their ability to identify research method limitations.

As documented by the virtual REU initiative, the local REU program structures an impactful student experience through the requirements of a research plan, student research notebook, deliberate development of students' professional, research, and communication skills through ARG activities, and a culminating research poster.
