<AbstractNarration>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused numerous deaths in the United States and around the world. Human genetic information may hold the answers for COVID-19 drug discovery. With the ability to sequence the human genome at low cost, this project aims to democratize genome sequence (GS) analysis on CloudLab (https://cloudlab.us/, an NSF-funded cloud computing research infrastructure) for accelerating the process of finding a cure for COVID-19. As a result, any researcher will be able to study differences in the genetic information of individuals affected by COVID-19 using CloudLab at no charge. This project will investigate efficient computing solutions to perform the data-intensive task of analyzing differences in individuals' genomes. It will also provide training opportunities for students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will democratize genome sequence (GS) analysis using CloudLab. Deep insights from genomic information of individuals can be extracted by researchers at scale. This work will lead to improved understanding of how commodity clusters, cloud infrastructure, and open-source software could be designed for large-scale GS storage, processing, and analysis. Specifically, it will result in new algorithms for exhaustive variant analysis (EVA), scheduling strategies for efficient execution of variant analysis tasks, and optimization techniques to speedup EVA and maximize resource utilization in a commodity cluster. It will provide low-level measurement data for network optimization when processing large-scale GS workloads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By empowering researchers with publicly available software tools and computing infrastructure for variant analysis at scale, this project could advance the understanding of how individuals respond to COVID-19 infection by uncovering deep relationships in genomic variants of individuals. It can enable new drug discovery and treatment strategies for COVID-19. A prototype of the tool will be made publicly available for research and education. The findings will be disseminated in the form of publications and software packages. New course modules will be developed; a workshop for high school students will be conducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project website is at https://github.com/MU-Data-Science/EVA. This repository will be maintained for 5 years after the completion of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The goal of this RAPID project wasto democratize whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis using CloudLab--an NSF-funded testbed for cloud computing research--at no charge. This requires new research to enable efficient storage and processing of large-scale WGS data using commodity clusters. Through WGS analysis, researchers can better understand an individual's risk to diseases such as COVID-19. More specifically, this project focused on variant calling, which is a fundamental task for identifying variants in an individual's genome compared to the reference genome.      Intellectual Merit: This project led to the development of a new approach for efficient variant calling on large number of human genomes using cluster computing and big data technologies. The approach was based on asynchronous computations, minimal synchronization, and synergistic combination of data and task parallelism. Due to improved cluster utilization, the approach was significantly faster than the state of the art leading to faster execution of the variant calling pipelines.

The approach was evaluated on CloudLab using different hardware configurations in a single data center as well as combining compute resources across two data centers in CloudLab. This project also studied the network traffic generated during variant calling. The findings indicated that the network bandwidth utilization was dependent on the compute and memory resources in a cluster as these dictated the degree of parallelism and hence, the amount of network traffic.
