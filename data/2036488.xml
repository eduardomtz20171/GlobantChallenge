<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The Voices of Integrating Culture in the Earth Sciences (VOICES) is a collaborative pilot study focused on identifying new pathways to dismantle persistent barriers in the recruitment, retention, and representation of different racial, ethnic and cultural groups, including the intersectionality of those with disabilities.VOICES contributes to a greater awareness of cultural knowledge and best practices in diversity, equity, and inclusion in the Earth sciences, with implications of reaching a broader segment of the STEM community. This project will target key areas of engagement related to personal identity, feeling of belonging, history of place, and sense of security from underrepresented minorities. VOICES uses creative strategies within a social behavioral framework, to address those elements that have the potential to shift from the traditions and legacies of a historically exclusive discipline into a more diverse Earth science community. Including voices from distinct cultural values and perspectives that are commonly undervalued, can result in changing exclusionary teaching, learning, and research practices. By highlighting individual voices as part of a collective whole, a more powerful, awakened, and inclusive community has the potential to transform strategies to engage leaders and learners in Earth science disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Voices of Integrating Culture in the Earth Sciences project will invoke the power of disaggregated stories and individual cultural identities that persevere despite the traditional expectations, values, and methods of teaching and learning Earth science. VOICES has four primary elements: Identity, Belonging, Place, and Security. Each element reflects different contexts within Earth science education (e.g., field and classroom learning environments, and career development) for groups of diverse students, faculty and professionals. Using a mixture of social behavioral approaches including surveys focus groups and 3 thematic workshops, VOICES will focus on the interrelationship of Identity, Belonging, Place and Security through the lens of those who are commonly underrepresented in the Earth sciences. Thematic workshops (Nagaajiwanaang, Barataria and Potomac) use cultural histories and places to anchor workshop activities and outcomes around diversity and inclusion approaches to integrating culture in field experiences. VOICES represents a novel and highly interdisciplinary approach will lead to: 1) a more culturally robust science community through broadening the awareness of cultural and intersectional knowledge across multiple underrepresented groups, 2) the establishment of a national diversity champions network VOICES Net as a sustainable communication platform, and 3) the design and deployment of best culturally inclusive practices for welcoming all students and scientists from groups underrepresented in the Earth sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

How does cultural heritage rooted in different forms of expression get incorporated in scientific data? The Earth Sciences face a unique challenge as a broad discipline, on how to use different forms of knowledge to determine critical issues in the environment such as signifcant trends of species important for subsistence, or biodiversity loss and the impacts of such loss on different cultures within a particular place. Four elements of engagement: identity, belonging, place, and security, help define how different knowledge systems may be important for the engagement and retention of science practioners to both embrace and respect the many different ways of knowing: &nbsp;Identity is a deeply rooted express of a culture often expressed through the arts. Yet how an individual self identifies as a scientist that can use different ways of knowing needs to be part of the very mindset of being a scientist. Belonging focuses on structure andf beliefs: how a person feels a sense of belonging and identity tie closely to a desire to pursue and persist in a scientific field without the "imposter" syndrome. Place, the third element, is not necessarily physical or a geographically location specific to a particular culture--but can be. &nbsp;Place is the centering concept of identity whetther through a place that is "special" to a particular person through a historical or intensively personal perspective (special private places for example). The fourth element, security, is arguably the most complex as in todays society. Security is defined by a person's experience and comfort and includes intangible elements often overlooked. The Earth sciences shares a common metric of a field experience through informal learning settings and all four elements identity, belonging, place and security contribute to a diverse persons perception of that field experience. A field site on public or private lands; versus more formal settings such as a laboratory or field research station--each plays a role in identity, security, place and belonging--the intersections of these roles are often overlooked in recruitment and retention exercises in academic settings. VOICES approached the four elements: identity, belonging, place and security, using seminars, training sessions, and personal stories related to the prinicipals' own identites. Being a scientist, being in the field and feeling secure are all part of knowing and the explorations of the VOICES project highlighted these elements for all attendees.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 02/06/2024<br> Modified by: Gillian&nbsp;Bowser</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2036488/2036488_10707160_1707263180147_Screenshot_2024_02_06_at_4.42.48__8239_PM--rgov-214x142.png" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2036488/2036488_10707160_1707263180147_Screenshot_2024_02_06_at_4.42.48__8239_PM--rgov-800width.png" title="VOICES-exploring different ways of knowing"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2036488/2036488_10707160_1707263180147_Screenshot_2024_02_06_at_4.42.48__8239_PM--rgov-66x44.png" alt="VOICES-exploring different ways of knowing"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Identity, belonging and place are elements of cultural identity in sciences that bring different ways of knowing.</div> <div class="imageCredit">g. bowser</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gillian&nbsp;Bowser <div class="imageTitle">VOICES-exploring different ways of knowing</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2036488/2036488_10707160_1707272335144__K7A5570--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2036488/2036488_10707160_1707272335144__K7A5570--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Identifying as an earth scientist"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2036488/2036488_10707160_1707272335144__K7A5570--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Identifying as an earth scientist"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Identity, belonging, place and security are four elements important for identifying as a diverse field scientist.</div> <div class="imageCredit">G. bowser</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Gillian&nbsp;Bowser <div class="imageTitle">Identifying as an earth scientist</div> </div> </li></ul> </div> </div></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
