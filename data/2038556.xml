<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[As both real and simulated data become increasingly complex due to improved instrumentation and deeper understanding of the underlying data-generating mechanisms, improved statistical methodology is required for proper analysis. Fields such as astronomy and biology that have spatial intricate, web-like data (e.g., the large-scale structure of the Universe, fibrin networks) can benefit from methodology that exploits the web-like information.  The field of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has great potential for the innovations needed to address these important and challenging scientific questions.  This project will extend existing TDA algorithms, statistical theory and applications, and make the advancement easily accessible by incorporating the work into the freely available R package TDA.  Moreover, the research will train undergraduate and graduate students in an interdisciplinary and collaborative environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are (1) to extend existing algorithms in TDA to allow statistically rigorous inferences and improved visualization, (2) to develop the statistical theory necessary to apply hypothesis testing to sets of topological descriptors, (3) to develop justifiable algorithms for parameter selection, and (4) to apply these methods to complex data, especially to critical areas in astrophysics.  These developments will make TDA more accessible to scientists and data analysts across disciplines and will give TDA a rigorous statistical foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project developed statistically rigorous topological data analysis methods for complex data, especially for critical areas in astronomy. Using topological characterizations of data, called persistence diagrams, this work developed a framework for inference and prediction using functional summaries of persistence diagrams. This framework was demonstrated through the classification of simulated prostate cancer histology data, and hypothesis testing to discriminate images of human and monkey fibrin. The hypothesis testing approach was adapted for a cosmology application that successfully discriminates the large-scale structure of the Universe generated under cold dark matter and warm dark matter models. While persistence diagrams are appealing and informative data summaries, the computational burden to compute a diagram can be substantial, especially for larger datasets. This work developed an initial strategy for estimating a persistence diagram for big data, which is anticipated to be useful for cosmological simulation data among many other areas in science. Topological summaries can also be useful for characterizing patterns in data, such as images or 3D shapes. Motivated by a challenge in cell biology, this work developed an approach to define confidence regions on a persistence diagram given only a single image of a cell to support biologists in assessing particular patterns exhibited by the cell. In addition to these advances, this work has contributed to extending and improving the interpretation of the weighted Euler characteristic transform (which is useful for characterizing the shape of images), a new method for estimating the mean of a type of functional summary of a persistence diagram that reduces or removes the bias in the traditional approach, a new method for analyzing irregularly-spaced time series data (which is a common setting in astronomy), and extending a point-process functional summary for the detection of astrophysical neutrinos.
