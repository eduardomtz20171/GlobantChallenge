<AbstractNarration>This project meets the goals of the GOLD-EN EAGER framework by providing a mechanism to identify, recruit, promote, and support a growing cohort of diversity leaders.  It will empower those leaders by developing their skill to champion diversity and by inserting them into the extensive volunteer structure of the American Meteorological Society (AMS). That volunteer structure reaches across the academic, government, and private sectors.  The project will involve experts in diversity, equity, and inclusion training to expand and hone the DEIBA STARS (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Belonging, and Accessibility Skill-building and Transfer in the Atmospheric and Related Sciences) curriculum needed for professional development to produce successful diversity leaders. It will also offer a mechanism to apply that curriculum to early career members of the community and expand their impact across the breadth of the community as those individuals move into leadership roles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed DEIBA STARS project will work with DEIBA experts to hone curricula for use in expanded Early Career Leadership Academy (ECLA) programing. It will serve early career professionals by providing pathways to exercise their new leadership skills through volunteer service, while also building their professional networks in programs that align with their expertise and career goals.  It also engages individuals trained in DEIBA who have the skills to promote positive cultural change in the AMS volunteer structure in addition to other forms of engagement they can exercise at their home organizations. Critically, this approach will also help retain members of historically underrepresented groups by enhancing their peer networks, which can serve as a strong support system, and by providing these individuals with new opportunities for professional satisfaction and career advancement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

A primary focus of ECLA is supporting women, people of color, LGBTQ+, and people with disabilities. ECLA is a platform for the development of skills, such as conflict resolution and leadership during a crisis, that are not taught in traditional classroom settings, yet are crucial for successful careers and inclusive workplaces. The long-term aim of the academy is to build and sustain a diverse network of early career professionals that can contribute in a positive and purposeful way to the AMS and the scientific community more broadly.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Recent studies have shown that diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts </span><span>are important for employee recruitment and retention. Therefore, preparing early career scientists with skills that empower them to pursue leadership roles within their respective workplaces can have positive and long-term effects, especially if their leadership promotes a culture of equity, inclusion, and justice. Successful leadership requires more than the ability to address inequities and show vulnerability, it also requires understanding of the intersection of our identities, unconscious biases, microaggressions, and the impacts of gender bias and racism in the workplace. Skills on how to intervene when witnessing problematic situations are paramount for developing inclusive leadership. With support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through an Early-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER), the 2022 and 2023 ECLA program saw the </span><span>purposeful addition of equity and inclusion training. The Office of Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) collaborated with the ECLA planning committee to adapt their UNEION (UCAR/NCAR Equity and Inclusion) training program for the needs of early career leaders. The ECLA UNEION program covered topics related to power and privilege, gender, and race, and included bystander intervention training. UNEION aims to train participants on how to build inclusive teams, facilitate diversity-related conversations within their divisions, and identify practices that can promote a positive workplace and volunteer culture. The addition of UNEION to the program has further amplified the rich network of peer-mentors among the ECLA graduates and has created a community of early career leaders committed to actively fostering equity and inclusion in the WWCE.&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Through informal feedback as well as the 2022 and 2023 program evaluations, we have evidence that ECLA is supporting the growth of early career leadership. For example, the 2022 program evaluation found that nearly three-quarters of respondents (73%) reported making changes to their leadership style or practices and nearly all respondents reported that they have already, or plan, to undertake new leadership roles as a result of their participation in ECLA. The 2023 program evaluation showed that over half of respondents made changes in their leadership style or practices during or just after participating in ECLA, with about 90% of respondents reporting changes six months later. For both cohorts, every participant said they had learned skills that will support them in creating change, practicing inclusive leadership, and further developing their leadership skills.&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Thanks to the NSF EAGER grant, during 2022 and 2023, ECLA was also able to provide participants with partial-to-full reimbursement for travel and lodging during the in-person component of the academy. Without this financial support, many early career professionals would not be able to participate. For example, one-third of ECLA 2022 respondents reported that the NSF funding was essential for their participation.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The success of the program also relies upon AMS volunteers and staff who comprise its planning committee (PC), many of whom are graduates of ECLA. The PC develops the annual program which includes five real-time, virtual leadership webinars, and culminates in a two-and-one-half day leadership intensive, held in person. Upon the completion of ECLA 2024, there will be more than 125 alums of the academy. This growing network of early career professionals in the WWCE are poised to drive change and model inclusive leadership within their home organizations and, more broadly, across the AMS and the WWCE.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 07/18/2024<br> Modified by: Kathryn&nbsp;J&nbsp;Putsavage</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2039488/2039488_10723882_1721328800262_IMG_1513--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2039488/2039488_10723882_1721328800262_IMG_1513--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ECLA 2022 Graduates -
