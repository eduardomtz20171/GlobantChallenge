<AbstractNarration>In order to understand earthquake hazard, scientists investigate the record of past earthquakes to as a means to constrain the possible size of future earthquakes and how often they might recur. In regions with limited historical records or large, infrequent events, the evidence is held in the geologic effects of ancient ground-surface ruptures. But not all earthquakes produce these ruptures nor are they always well preserved in the geology. The proposed work seeks to expand the geologic tool kit for earthquake history by exploring the record of earthquakes preserved in the amount and chemical make-up of minerals related to hot springs along active faults. Because faults can be conduits for hot-spring waters, and because earthquakes change the internal structure of faults, researchers expect to see differences in hot-spring minerals deposited before and after past earthquakes. The field sites, located in a region of central Nevada with a history of large earthquakes, contain many hot-spring mineral deposits, along with other geological features that record earthquake and ground water history, making it an ideal place to test the relationship between earthquakes and changes in hot-spring mineral deposits. Results from this study will provide important new insights into the lifecycle of hot springs and other hydrothermal systems and have direct bearing on earthquake risk in a seismically active part of the western United States.  If this work shows that hot-spring minerals record past earthquakes, hot-spring minerals could be used for understanding earthquake hazard in other places of the United States and around the world. In addition to the scientific objectives of the project, it will also contribute to the training and research efforts of honors undergraduate students in an important STEM discipline, it will support postdoctoral training for an early career female researcher thus broadening participation of underrepresented groups in the earth sciences, and it will provide for educational outreach activities and development of online learning materials in conjunction with IRIS (Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology) and the educational outreach program GeoFORCE. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrothermal systems are transient features in active tectonic and magmatic regimes, representing the ephemeral co-location of permeability, heat, and fluid. They are sensitive to both internal and external perturbations from the many factors influencing local hydrology. The proposed work will explore millennial-scale variability in discharge, composition and temperature at several hot-spring travertine deposits to explore the impact of climate and seismic forcing on hydrothermal systems. The approach includes: 1) construction of physical, chemical, and isotopic travertine stratigraphy from field mapping, shallow (~10 meter) core, major and trace element analyses, and stable, radiogenic, and clumped-isotope analyses; and 2) geochronology to constrain the time of physical and chemical changes preserved in the spring deposits. The field sites, located in Buena Vista and Dixie valleys in the northern Central Nevada Seismic Belt, contain multiple travertine deposits, detailed paleohydrologic records from Late Pleistocene to Holocene lake level fluctuations, and a robust record of large (M 6 to &gt;M 7) Late Pleistocene to historic earthquakes, making it an ideal place to evaluate the mechanisms influencing hydrothermal discharge across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The stratigraphic, chemical, and thermal histories of travertine deposits resulting from this study will provide important new insights into the life cycle of fluid flow from faults across multiple time scales, from co-seismic rupture and interseismic sealing to the influence of regional hydrologic changes. Chemical evidence for seismic events in the hydrologic record preserved in these deposits would add to the understanding of regional seismic risk independent of discrete surface deformation and would represent a new approach for identifying paleoseismic events. This has direct bearing on seismic recurrence intervals in an historically active region of the western United States and broader implications for seismic hazard assessments in a variety of global settings, where hydrothermal activity and seismicity coincide with population centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Travertine is a rock that forms at hot springs and holds information about how the water flow and water chemistry at the spring has changed over time. Over the course of two years, we visited eight sites in central Nevada, in an area that has both active and extinct hot springs and a history of earthquake activity. Our aim was to understand how earthquakes may have influenced the hot springs by looking for chemical changes in the travertine. At each site, we mapped the distribution of the hot spring deposits and sampled the rock and water. Each site reveals a different aspect of the relationship between earthquakes, climatic change and the hot springs. At Hyder hot springs, the form of the travertine mounds shows evidence that they were present during a time when vast lakes covered the region (Figure), more than a hundred-thousand years ago. This persistence is echoed by the chemical analyses from other sites that suggest the source of the water (deep underground) has been the same through time, though the flow at each spring may have varied. At Cottonwood Canyon, different chemical signatures suggest that deposits there formed in cold water, rather than hot, recording the influence of an ancient wet climate on the spring water. At other sites, we see direct interaction between the hot springs and active faults. We may be able to use extinct hot spring deposits to determine the age of the last fault slip at the Kyle site; while near Senator Fumaroles, the hot spring deposits have changed how the fault scarp can erode, making interpretation of the age of the faulting more complicated.  Through continued synthesis and interpretation of the observations we gathered with this research, we aim to contribute new understanding past earthquakes in Central Nevada, which has a history of large earthquakes. If successful, our approach may also help uncover earthquake histories in other regions of the world. Improved understanding of groundwater flow from faults, such as those that create the central Nevada hot springs, also has important applications in the sustainable management of geothermal resources. The mapping techniques we employed are also useful for monitoring changes to natural hydrothermal systems and the impacts of geothermal energy development. The grant supported one full time, post-doctoral researcher and group of part-time collaborators, ranging in experience and expertise from established professors, laboratory scientists, to graduate students and undergraduate geology majors. This team of fourteen researchers includes eleven people from demographics underrepresented in the geosciences, including ten women and four people from minoritized groups (overlapping categories). The project provided novel field and laboratory experience to nine students, and reached additional students through both a graduate and undergraduate seminar and short course. At least three of the students have continued in related work beyond this project. The postdoctoral researcher who led this project has gone on to create a new company focused on geothermal energy production and monitoring.  By contributing basic knowledge to the broader goals of understanding earthquake history and the flow of geothermal fluids along fault zones, this work may ultimately contribute to reducing the risk of earthquakes to people and infrastructure and may improve the sustainable management of geothermal resources for energy production. We hope our educational resources will improve public understanding of these phenomena and inspire more students to study Earth science.
