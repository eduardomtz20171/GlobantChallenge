<AbstractNarration>With the rapid continuing spread of COVID-19, it is clearly important to be able to track its progress over time in order to be better prepared to anticipate its emergence and spread in new regions as well as declines in its presence in regions thereby leading to or justifying "reopening" decisions.  There are many applications and web sites that monitor officially released numbers of cases which are likely to be the most accurate methods for tracking the progress of COVID-19; however, they do not necessarily paint a complete picture. To begin filling any gaps in official reports, the project will develop the NewsStand CoronaViz (abbreviated as CoronaViz) web application aimed at allowing users to explore the geographic spread in discussions about COVID-19 through analysis of keyword prevalence in geotagged news articles and tweets in relation to the real spread of COVID-19 as measured by the confirmed cases numbers reported by the authorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoronaViz users will have access to dynamic variants of the disease-related variables corresponding to the number of confirmed cases, active cases, deaths, and recoveries (where they are provided) via a map query interface.  They will also have the ability to step forward and backward in time using both a variety of temporal window sizes (day, week, month, or combinations thereof) in addition to user-defined varying spatial window sizes specified by direct manipulation actions (e.g., pan, zoom, and hover) as well as textually (e.g., by the name of the containing continent, country, state or province, or county).  The result is an animation and that also supports zooming which means that users zoom in on a map they get more data rather than magnified data as is the case in most existing systems.  CoronaViz is not restricted to COVID-19 and can be used for other diseases such as Ebola.  Having a system such as CoronaViz is useful should the COVID-19 pandemic return.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Objective While COVID-19 spawned many dashboards for visualizing outbreaks,    most separate geospatial and temporal data into discrete visualizations or tables.    Further, the common use of choropleth maps or space-filling map overlays supports    only a single geospatial variable at once, making it difficult to compare the temporal    and geospatial trends of multiple, potentially interacting variables,    such as active cases, deaths, and vaccinations.  Materials and Methods We present CoronaViz, an epidemiological visualization system that conveys    multilayer, spatiotemporal data in a single, interactive display.    CoronaViz encodes variables with concentric, hollow circles, termed geocircles,    allowing multiple variables via color encoding and avoiding occlusion problems.    Animation controls let users seek through time manually or view the pandemic    unfolding in accelerated time. An adjustable time window allows aggregation    from single days to the entire available range.  Results Focus sessions with epidemiologists confirmed the importance of spatiotemporal    queries and the utility of CoronaViz for answering them, while providing direction    for future development. In a user study, non-experts tasked with performing    such queries preferred CoronaViz to multi-view dashboards from the    New York Times and Johns Hopkins University.  Discussion Conveying complex, multivariate data necessarily involves trade-offs.    Our studies suggest the importance of complementary visualization strategies,    with our animated spatiotemporal encoding filling important needs for    exploration and presentation.  Conclusion CoronaViz's novel use of animated geocircles makes it both a valuable addition    to interactive COVID-19 dashboards and a platform for empowering experts    and the public during future disease outbreaks. CoronaViz is open-source and    a live instance is freely hosted at http://coronaviz.umiacs.io.     Last Modified: 05/09/2024       Submitted by: HananSamet]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
