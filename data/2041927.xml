<AbstractNarration>In this project, the investigators will engage high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in cutting-edge cell biology research to discover how compartments within cells change shape in response to nutrient availability. Mitochondria are energy-generating compartments present in large numbers in complex cells. Mitochondria have a characteristic shape in different cell types, which is closely correlated to function. The shape of mitochondria is also highly dynamic, and can readily shift to adapt to different energy requirements. To discover shared mechanisms for establishment and maintenance of mitochondrial shape, the researchers will use model organisms from a group of single-celled parasites called the kinetoplastids. Kinetoplastids are unusual in that each cell contains only a single mitochondrion that undergoes dramatic changes in structure and function as the parasites alternate between insect and mammalian hosts. This arrangement greatly facilitates the analysis of changes in mitochondrial structure, and will reveal shared mechanisms by which cells control the number and distribution of their mitochondria. Due to their evolutionary position, kinetoplastids possess a basal set of mitochondrial shape proteins, the investigation of which will provide insight into how these processes work in a wide variety of cell types. To allow for better understanding of these complex structures, engineering students will create mitochondrial models using a 3-D printer. This interdisciplinary effort will illustrate the connections between engineering and biology, and will demonstrate how this technology may be applied for enhanced understanding and communication of fundamental questions in cell biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kinetoplastid parasites such as Crithidia fasciculata and Trypanosoma brucei have long been important models for basic cellular processes. Kinetoplastid mitochondria in particular have unusual features, including the fact that there is only one mitochondrion per cell. This necessitates a thus far unknown mechanism for regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and division within the cell cycle. In addition, the shape and function of the mitochondrion are dramatically and reversibly altered in different life cycle stages of the parasite. In other organisms, mitochondrial shape is established and maintained by membrane fusion and fission events, collectively called mitochondrial dynamics. While much of the machinery for mitochondrial dynamics has been described in yeast and humans, how these processes are regulated is not well understood, and not all mitochondrial dynamics proteins are conserved. The investigators will use a variety of cellular and molecular biology techniques to identify the mechanisms controlling mitochondrial shape in kinetoplastids, providing important insight into how these processes evolved and their function in other organisms.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Complex cells, including those of animals and plants, have a variety of subcellular compartments called organelles. These organelles allow for the compartmentalization of certain pathways, increasing their efficiency and permitting finely-tuned regulation of their activity. Mitochondria are energy-producing organelles required for the breakdown of nutrients. Mitochondria can assume varied shapes, from spheres to tubular networks, which has consequences for mitochondrial function. Mitochondria can also change their shape in response to different nutrient environments and energetic needs. Cells have therefore evolved complex machinery to establish, maintain, and dynamically alter mitochondrial shape. Many details of how this is accomplished remain to be uncovered.</p> <p>Trypanosomatids are single-celled parasites that diverged early from the main eukaryotic lineage. Each parasite cell contains a single mitochondrion consisting of tubules that extend throughout the cell body. Some species, such as&nbsp;<em>Trypanosoma brucei</em>, drastically alter mitochondrial shape and function to survive in their different hosts. By determining how and why these parasites change their mitochondrial shape, we can gain insight into how these processes evolved, the interrelationship between organelle shape and function, and identify new factors that may be broadly conserved.</p> <p>Intellectual merit: Using live-cell imaging, we provided the first evidence that the single mitochondrion of trypanosomatids is dynamic. We also showed that mitochondrial growth, network topology, and network division was tightly coordinated with division of the entire cell, hinting at molecular cross-talk between these two replication cycles. Trypanosomatids seem to have either reduced or novel protein machinery for dividing mitochondria, a process required for both cell division and mitochondrial remodeling. Through protein-protein interaction studies, we have identified proteins that stably bind to a known mitochondrial division protein, providing new avenues of investigation into the mechanism and regulation of this process. Surprisingly, this approach also revealed proteins associated with another organelle, called a glycosome, that is involved in sugar metabolism. Microscopy confirmed that this division protein is associated with glycosomes that appear to be pinching in two. This suggests that mitochondria and glycosomes in trypanosomatids share division machinery, allowing for possible coordination of division and changes in shape across multiple cellular structures. Genetic alterations in the level of division proteins accordingly disrupted the formation and maintenance of glycosomes. We also discovered a chemical inhibitor that blocks both cell and mitochondrial division, and which will be used as a tool to reveal novel division proteins in genetic screens. Other future studies will determine the function of new putative mitochondrial division proteins and reveal how and when the protein machinery for division is recruited to different organelles.</p> <p>Broader impacts: This funding provided opportunities for undergraduates and other early career scientists to perform research. Most of these students have gone on to pursue careers in research or medicine. These scientists co-authored papers and presented their work at local, national, and international conferences. The principal investigator participated in science-themed outreach events and ran two teacher workshops to provide professional development to middle and high school teachers looking for innovative ways to teach cell biology to their students. Research for this project was also incorporated into several course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) in which students learned to grow parasites, induce changes in gene expression, and visualize the mitochondrion. Finally, this award expanded the use of&nbsp;<em>Crithidia fasciculata</em>, an insect parasite, as a model trypanosomatid for researchers working at primarily undergraduate institutions.
