<AbstractNarration>This project will support International Research Collaboratives (IRCs), which are groups of law and science researchers organized to undertake various sociolegal research projects. As well, the project will support the Junior Scholars Workshop (JSW), which will to train and mentor the next generation of sociolegal scholars. The project will connect and engage an interdisciplinary group of scholars and researchers with current and cutting-edge theoretical, methodological, and policy approaches, thus enhancing law and science scholarship. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the cross-disciplinary research endeavors of the IRCs by providing support for scholars to participate in them at the 2022 annual conference of the Law and Society Association. The research activities of the IRCs will build upon the many research collaborations that have produced important scientific discoveries by advancing knowledge and understanding in the several interdisciplinary and disciplinary-specific fields of sociolegal studies. As well, the project will bring together entry-level scholars at the JSW, which will serve to guide, prepare, and mentor the next generation of sociolegal researchers, further developing and advancing law and science scholars and scholarship. In doing so, the project will link a new cohort of scholars with more established researchers, thus providing networking and collaborative opportunities while fostering the future of the sociolegal field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[          The overall aim of the NSF grant, Research Collaborations and Mentorship of Sociolegal Scholars, was to support and encourage research on the relationship between law and society, through the development of collaborative, international and interdisciplinary research teams dubbed International Research Collaboratives (IRCs). The grant helped connect U.S. scholars with colleagues from other countries in order to broaden their perspectives and to foster research collaborations. In turn, these collaborative activities have had important policy implications. They have informed debates on a variety of contemporary global problems that affect the interplay between law and society, such as democracy and authoritarianism, human trafficking, gender equality, pandemics, climate change and other environmental crises, justice, and human rights. The Law and Society Association (LSA), an interdisciplinary scholarly organization committed to social scientific, interpretive, and historical analyses of law across multiple social contexts in the U.S. and abroad, hosted the IRCs and provided essential organizational and other support for their operation.   The grant supported 141 trips by scholars from low and middle-income countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, allowing them to travel to an International Law and Society conference in Lisbon, Portugal in 2022, and to the annual LSA conference in 2023 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in order to engage in, complete, and present collaborative research projects. A specially appointed committee chose scholars in the 41 IRCs for travel support using a rigorous selection process that considered the scholarly excellence of the IRC project and the role and needs of the IRC members who requested travel funding assistance. The beneficiaries represented a rich variety of disciplinary orientations, universities, and countries. The collaborative research projects of the IRCs examined topics of importance in U.S. foreign and domestic policy, using four main approaches: (1) comparison across countries; (2) the international transplantation of legal institutions or practices from one country to another; (3) international legal practices and institutions; and (4) the effects of international and transnational legal institutions and practices on local institutions and practices.           The grant produced four key outcomes. First, it fostered the creation and strengthening of international and interdisciplinary scholarly networks. Second, it was instrumental in the generation of valuable collaborative research undertaken with scientific rigor and relevance. Third, the grant facilitated the communication of the research to audiences at academic and professional meetings, including the LSA conferences.

The IRC initiative supported by this grant will have a substantial impact upon the future of law and social science research. Even though many IRCs have now completed their collaborative activities and the grant has concluded, many of the international scholarly networks that originated through the IRCs are still active.
