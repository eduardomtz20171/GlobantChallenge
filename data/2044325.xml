<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest of improving STEM teaching and learning by identifying and integrating critical digital pedagogy methods to prepare pre-service teachers to teach inquiry-based STEM education effectively in online learning environments. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, both K-12 and higher education underwent a dramatic shift to primarily online instruction. With the realization that multiple modes of instruction are possible, pre-service teacher programs must prepare students to teach in online environments. This IUSE Engaged Student Learning Level 1 project seeks to combine inquiry-based approaches to learning with critical digital pedagogy. It supports Carroll University faculty members in transforming their teaching to facilitate inquiry-based STEM education in online learning environments. In turn, this is expected to improve undergraduate STEM teaching and learning for pre-service teachers at Carroll University, as education faculty will integrate critical digital pedagogy methods into their K-12 STEM methods courses. Critical digital pedagogy impels the reimagining of how and where learning occurs, and how all students and teachers, regardless of culture, ability, or boundaries are empowered (Stommel, 2014). When combined with inquiry-based learning the approach offers the opportunity to address meaningful real-world problems in ways that require critical and creative thinking and emphasize community and collaboration. Such an integrated and sustained multidisciplinary perspective is intended to prepare Carroll pre-service teachers to teach inquiry-based K-12 STEM education in a variety of delivery methods, including in fully online learning environments. The long-term goal is to develop a critical digital pedagogy model that prepares pre-service teachers to facilitate the learning of STEM concepts and processes in online learning environments that are equitable and inclusive of all learners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The implementation of inquiry-based practices that value active learning, immersion in authentic settings, engagement in reasoning and problem solving, and the development of creativity are shown to facilitate effective student learning. However, the implementation of these pedagogical methods and the accompanying research are contextualized within in-person learning environments. Therefore, this project’s first objective is to identify best practices for incorporating critical digital pedagogy into inquiry-based, online STEM education for pre-service teachers, and begin integrating these new instructional techniques into methods courses.  A second objective is to increase STEM and education faculty members’ efficacy around the incorporation of critical digital pedagogy into methods courses for pre-service teachers.  The third objective is to use new instructional techniques to improve pre-service teachers’ sense of efficacy for effectively teaching inquiry-based STEM education in online learning environments. This project emphasizes examination of equity and access issues in tandem with instructional changes to ensure all students can access these learning opportunities in both K-12 and higher education settings. The project investigators are collaborating with the Wisconsin Evaluation Collaborative, within the Wisconsin Center for Education Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, to conduct both formative and summative assessments of the project. The results will be published in peer-reviewed publications, presented at national conferences, and distributed widely through an online professional development micro-credential. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.  The Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship (Noyce) Program is providing co-funding for this IUSE: EHR project to support the project's preservice teacher preparation goals, which are well-aligned with Noyce Program goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Carroll University Critical Digital Pedagogy Project for Inquiry-Based Online STEM Education was a three-year National Science Foundation grant funded under the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education division. The focus of this Engaged Student Learning Level 1 project was to identify and integrate critical digital pedagogy methods that prepare pre-service teachers to teach inquiry-based STEM education effectively and equitably in online learning environments.         The NSF grant (2044325) was awarded in July of 2021 to an interdisciplinary research team at Carroll University consisting of faculty members in Education, Mathematics, and Biology and Environmental Education who partnered with consultants with expertise in instructional design and critical pedagogy. The Wisconsin Evaluation Collaborative served as the external evaluator. While the implementation of inquiry-based practices that value active learning, immersion in authentic settings, engagement in reasoning and problem-solving, and the development of creativity have been shown to facilitate effective student learning, the implementation of these pedagogical methods and the accompanying research are contextualized within face-to-face learning environments. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020, the delivery of instruction in both K-12 schooling and higher education underwent a dramatic shift to a primarily online mode for institutions and students nationwide. This shift will have lasting implications in the field of education, and these circumstances present an emergent need to examine how educators can effectively implement inquiry-based practices within online learning environments.   The research team accomplished three objectives through this project. The first was to identify best practices for facilitating critical digital pedagogy in inquiry-based, online STEM education and the second objective was facilitating faculty professional learning to increase STEM and education faculty members efficacy for integrating best practices into methods courses for preservice teachers. The third objective was improving pre-service teachers' knowledge, skills, and dispositions for effectively teaching inquiry-based STEM education in online learning environments. As a result of this exploration, the research team developed the Carroll University STEM Critical Digital Pedagogy Model, which identifies four criteria and thirteen related instructional indicators for facilitating inquiry-based STEM education that is equitable and inclusive of all learners through a variety of delivery modalities, including in fully online learning environments. The four criteria include: fostering a community of learners and enhancing collaboration among students; honoring multiple ways of knowing and emphasizing the importance of the inquiry process; grounding inquiry in culturally relevant and meaningful STEM contexts; and, engaging in critical reflection to recognize whether and how communication and collaboration are inclusive of all socio-cultural perspectives. This innovative framework identifies specific instructional strategies university faculty, supervisors, and cooperating teachers use to provide feedback to preservice student teachers on their actual implementation of online teaching.   To increase the efficacy of university faculty and K-12 preservice teachers in implementing the CU STEM Critical Digital Pedagogy Model, the research team and the instructional design consultant developed a series of asynchronous, fully online professional learning workshops called Modify; the use of the term Modify is from the SAMR framework (Puentedura, 2006) and was chosen to emphasize the goal of fostering transformative learning experiences through the use of technology. Modify for Faculty supported the professional learning of university faculty in Education and the STEM fields while Modify for Cooperating Teachers was offered to partner teachers in the field who served as mentors to Carrolls student teachers, and 47 full-time and part-time faculty participated in professional learning opportunities centered on these workshops. Modify for Preservice Teachers has two versions. Modify 1 is completed while students take coursework in education foundations and engage in their first clinical experience and Modify 2 is completed concurrently with methods coursework as preservice teachers participate in embedded field experiences and prepare for their second clinical experience. During the three-year project, 189 teacher candidates completed the online modules to develop their technological pedagogical content knowledge (Mishra & Koehler, 2006) for online teaching. The strategic implementation of the Modify series is a permanent addition to the coursework in teacher education programs at Carroll University.   In addition to the impacts noted above, the research team published research findings for this IUSE project in two conference proceedings, submitted two additional manuscripts (currently under review), and presented their research at the Society for Informational Technology and Teacher Education (SITE) annual meetings in 2023 and 2024 and the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Research Conferences (NCTM) in 2022 and 2024.
