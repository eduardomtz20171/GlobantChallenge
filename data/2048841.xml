<AbstractNarration>The average American household spends $665 per year playing state-run lottery games. Lottery revenues are valuable to state and local governments.  However, critics have claimed that state-run lotteries do not serve the public good, because lottery purchasers are overly optimistic about the chance they will win. This project seeks to answer the following question: should states run lotteries such as Mega Millions and Powerball, and if so, how should such lotteries be structured?  The answer depends on a series of larger questions in behavioral economics. How much of lottery consumption is driven by entertainment and other normatively acceptable preferences versus ignorance, innumeracy, and other behavioral factors that a social planner might want to mitigate? Do lower-income people spend more on lottery tickets, and if so is does this enhance the welfare consequences of offering lotteries (because it reflects consumer surplus for people with higher marginal utility) or does this decrease the welfare consequences of offering lotteries (because it reflects exploitation of behavioral bias)? The goal of this project is to study state-run lotteries by building on recent advances in behavioral public economics. The first step is to collect new empirical data and analyses that identify a set of statistics that determine optimal lottery policy. The second step is to use the empirical parameters to simulate the welfare effects of lotteries and different design choices. This will provide the first benefit-cost analysis of state-run lotteries that theoretically and quantitatively considers the alleged behavioral biases at the heart of the policy discussion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project studies optimal lottery policy through the lens of optimal taxation, where lotteries are a taxed good whose consumers may be subject to behavioral biases. The project starts with a derivation of new sufficient statistics formulas for optimal pricing and attributes of a government-provided good. The key parameters of the welfare formulas will be estimated using lottery prizes and sales data and a large new nationally representative survey. The prize and sales data allow estimation of how lottery demand varies with ticket prices, jackpot amounts and smaller prizes. The new survey will generate a nationally representative dataset of how lottery expenditures vary with income, and how they vary with measures of innumeracy and poor statistical reasoning. These empirical moments permit estimation of a structural model of lottery demand, which will be used to examine the welfare consequences of eliminating or restructuring state-run lotteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project answers the following question: Taking into account potential consumer mistakes, should states run lotteries such as Mega Millions and Powerball, and if so, how should such lotteries be structured? This question is of clear social significance. Americans spent $85 billion on lottery tickets in 2018 (NASPL 2020). This contributed $23 billion to state and local governments that year (NASPL 2020). This is more than the revenue raised by federal estate or tobacco taxes, and just less than the revenue raised by the federal gas tax. Americans spend more on lottery tickets than they do on cigarettes, and more than they do on music, sports tickets, movie tickets, books, and video games combined (Isidore 2015).</p> <div class="standard">We addressed this question with new data on how people respond to variation in prizes and sales, and a new nationally-representative survey linking lottery expenditures to household income and proxies for behavioral biases such as incorrect perceptions of lottery returns, over-optimism, or self control problems. We complement the reduced-form results from these data by calibrating a structural model of lottery demand, including nonlinear probability weights. Finally, we illustrate the policy relevance of our empirical estimates by considering state-run lotteries in an optimal taxation model, and deriving implications for welfare and optimal design.</div> <div class="standard"></div> <div class="standard">We find that the semi-elasticities of demand with respect to the jackpot expected value, second prize expected value, and price are about 1.7, statistically zero, and -0.5, respectively. Strikingly, this means that ticket sales increase over three times as much if the jackpot expected value increases by $1 than if the price decreases by $1. This is the opposite of what would be expected for risk-averse consumers, and it is not explained by substitution across games or time. This pattern is qualitatively consistent with the long literature on probability weighting.<br /> Quantitatively, however, the jackpot elasticity is so large relative to the second prize elasticity that our estimates cannot be fit by standard functional forms from the literature. We show that these estimated elasticities are instead consistent with the more recent neo-additive specification.</div> <div class="standard"></div> <div class="standard">In a nationally representative survey, we find that the spending distribution is highly skewed, generating some imprecision in the estimated means, but point estimates suggest that lottery spending declines moderately with income: people with household income under $50,000 spend 29 percent more on the lottery than people with household income above $100,000. Measures of perceived self-control problems, financial illiteracy, statistical mistakes (such as the Gambler's Fallacy, non-belief in the Law of Large Numbers, and difficulty calculating expected values), and incorrect beliefs about expected returns from lottery play are highly statistically significantly associated with more lottery spending. This holds both unconditionally and after controlling for demographics, risk aversion, and questions measuring how much people enjoy playing the lottery. Interestingly, not all of these relationships suggest that bias increases consumption: while in reality 60 percent of lottery revenues are returned to winners, the average person believes that the expected returns are only 29 percent, a misperception that presumably decreases demand.</div> <div class="standard"></div> <div class="standard">Motivated by our model, we use these results to estimate the quantity of lottery demand that is driven by behavioral biases. Regression predictions suggest that Americans would spend 43 percent less on lotteries if they had perfect self-control, had the financial literacy and statistical ability of the highest-scoring people in our sample, and had correct beliefs about expected returns. Lower-income people score lower on financial literacy and statistical ability, so the point estimates suggest that a larger share of their spending is attributable to bias. Although we control for a rich array of demographics and preference measures, a key caveat is that these regression predictions are not the causal effects of behavioral biases. With that important caveat, these results are consistent with concerns that behavioral biases play a role in lottery spending.</div> <div class="standard"></div> <div class="standard"> <div id="magicparlabel-5524825" class="standard">Using our structural model to simulate the implications of alternative lottery designs, we find that the optimal implicit tax rate on lotteries is slightly lower than current Mega Millions and Powerball designs. In our model, actual consumer surplus is much smaller than consumers' perceived surplus at our baseline behavioral bias estimates, but the current Mega Millions and Powerball designs increase welfare and deliver close to maximal welfare levels. A key channel for these gains comes through the effect on revenues: lotteries raise public funds while also generating (much smaller) consumer surplus for lottery purchasers. These results hinge on the magnitude of behavioral bias. For example, if we alternatively assume zero bias, then low-income heavy spenders derive the most surplus. If bias is more than about twice as large as our baseline estimate, lotteries would reduce overall welfare. This highlights the importance of our survey evidence but also underscores the need for future work.</div> </div> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 04/08/2024<br> Modified by: Dmitry&nbsp;Taubinsky</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2048841/2048841_10715454_1712607474037_Screenshot_2024_04_08_at_1.15.56__8239_PM--rgov-214x142.png" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2048841/2048841_10715454_1712607474037_Screenshot_2024_04_08_at_1.15.56__8239_PM--rgov-800width.png" title="Estimated Surplus from Lotteries in the Status Qu"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2048841/2048841_10715454_1712607474037_Screenshot_2024_04_08_at_1.15.56__8239_PM--rgov-66x44.png" alt="Estimated Surplus from Lotteries in the Status Qu"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This figure plots the estimated surplus per capita that each consumer type derives from $100 of per-capita spending on the status quo representative lottery in our structural model, relative to a setting with no lottery.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lockwood, Allcott, Taubinsky, Sial (2024). �What Drives Demand for State-Run Lotteries?
