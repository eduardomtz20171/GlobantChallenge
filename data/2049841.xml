<AbstractNarration>This award will provide funding for some specific activities of the Hunter College and African School of Economics Program to Expand Representation in Economics (HASPERE) is to increase the pool of economists from underrepresented backgrounds in academia and prestigious jobs in the private sector. To improve participation rates, economics programs need to create a critical mass of minority students, expand mentorship and financial support, and provide students exposure and access to experiences and networks that provide them with the motive and opportunities to pursue further studies and job opportunities in economics. NSF funding will provide resources for student support and for workshops that will help participating students enhance their skills in key methods used in economics research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To ensure that all incoming students have the mathematics and coding skills that are necessary for success throughout the program, HASPERE will include a two-week quantitatively-oriented summer camp to prepare incoming students for the program. During each semester of study, students in the HASPERE program will participate in workshops to enhance their technical skills in core areas of economics beyond the levels of the masters program. Enrolled students will not only benefit from supportive peers within their cohorts, but will also have personal and group mentors. In addition, in the second year of the program, students will be provided research experience opportunities with faculty at Hunter, ASE and a number of nearby institutions where faculty have pledged to support this program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
