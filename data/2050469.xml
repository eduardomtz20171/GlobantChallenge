<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national need for highly effective computer science teachers for grades 6–12. There is national momentum to expand K-12 student access to computer science education, including for historically underrepresented and otherwise marginalized youth. As of 2019, 34 states had moved toward this goal by developing K–12 computer science standards.  However, two-thirds of currently certified K–12 computer science teachers in the United States do not have a degree in computer science.  The limited formal preparation of these teachers raises concerns about the quality of K-12 computer science education across the Nation.  This project will lay the foundation for enhancing Kennesaw State University’s capacity to prepare secondary computer science teachers who have strong computer science knowledge and skills. Specifically, the project will: (1) examine needs in local school districts and the interests of computer science and mathematics majors in teaching as a career; (2) develop new undergraduate and graduate degree programs leading to computer science teacher licensure; (3) produce curricula, teacher professional development opportunities, and outreach programs to strengthen computer science education in Georgia, specifically in high-need districts; and (4) create a metro-Atlanta hub for computer science teacher education at the University. As a result, Kennesaw State University will develop capacity in four areas: student interest and expertise; curricular relevance; certification programs; and recruitment, retention, and advising.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project at Kennesaw State University includes partnerships with the Cobb County School District and the Georgia Department of Education to create multiple programs for computer science teacher education. Moreover, the project will design and implement activities targeting students, pre-service teachers, and in-service teachers with a goal to promote, recruit, and retain computer science teachers.  Programs to be developed include a Master of Arts in Teaching in Computer Science and a Secondary Computer Science teacher concentration in an existing Master’s of Education degree program.  The project will also develop and refine self-learning modules as supports for students preparing for the Georgia Assessment for the Certification of Educators Computer Science Assessment, which can be used to demonstrate content mastery for licensure in the state. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K–12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K–12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K–12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
