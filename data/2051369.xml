<AbstractNarration>Social scientists are increasingly using data from diverse, worldwide sources to understand the causes and consequences of social stratification, migration, economic development, cultural diversity and violent conflict. This work frequently requires merging multiple datasets over fine-grained sociopolitical categories (e.g., ethnicities, languages, religions, or provinces). However, different datasets often encode corresponding sociopolitical categories with different variable names, at different scales, and different points in.  These different encodings must be translated across datasets before merging, thereby creating a substantial bottleneck to interdisciplinary, comparative social science.  This project will build a new data analysis platform called SocioMap that will help overcome this bottleneck by providing tools for translating across a large and growing body of international social science datasets and for building new datasets from diverse existing datasets storing ethnic, religious, linguistic, and administrative boundaries in disparate, and non-compatible formats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SocioMap will be a user-friendly set of tools to help translate sociopolitical categories and classification schemes across multiple, external datasets. This project will focus on four kinds of categories — ethnicities, languages, religions, and administrative boundaries — that are commonly used in social science research.  The beta version of SocioMap will be injected with a critical mass of these categories and translations between these categories across dozens of common standards and hundreds of demographic surveys and censuses worldwide. Furthermore, SocioMap is designed to grow by permitting registered users to add new categories and translations for re-use in future projects.  SocioMap’s tools will help users: (1) explore contextual information about specific sociopolitical categories, (2) translate and share categories from new datasets, standards, and published studies, (3) merge novel combinations of datasets for researchers’ custom research needs, and (4) document key aspects of the analytical workflow that often go unreported and, in so doing, make analyses more reproducible. SocioMap complements existing observational datasets by providing tools for linking these datasets with social, cultural, and demographic data from a diverse and growing body of new datasets.  SocioMap’s capabilities will spur new interdisciplinary research, encourage new analyses of publicly funded data and re-assessments of the robustness and reproducibility of past findings.  It will also create a foundation for future work with other kinds of entities (e.g. political parties, non-governmental organizations, industry and occupation classifications, and firms) and for reconciling sociopolitical entities over longer historical periods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project built the SocioMap app, an interactive web-based tool enabling new interdisciplinary analyses of social data on thousands of ethnicities, religions, languages, and administrative subdistricts. Social scientists are increasingly using data from diverse, worldwide sources to understand the causes and consequences of social stratification, migration, economic development, cultural diversity and violent conflict. This work frequently requires merging data across multiple datasets by fine-grained sociopolitical categories (e.g., ethnicities, languages, religions, or provinces). However, different datasets often encode corresponding sociopolitical categories with different variable names, at different scales (e.g., Guatemala Indigenous vs. Maya vs. Kiche), and different points in time (e.g., Dutch Christian Union merged from two political parties in 2000). These different encodings must be translated across datasets before merging, thereby creating a substantial bottleneck to interdisciplinary, comparative social science. SocioMap helps overcome this bottleneck by providing tools for translating across a large and growing body of international social science datasets and for building new datasets from diverse existing datasets storing ethnic, religious, linguistic, and geospatial categories in disparate, and non-compatible formats.   This project built and disseminated a beta version of SocioMapa user-friendly set of tools to help translate sociopolitical categories and classification schemes across multiple, external datasets. This project focused on four kinds of categoriesethnicities, languages, religions, and subdistrictsthat are commonly used in social science research. Our team injected SocioMap with a critical mass of these categories ( 14K ethnicities,  2K religions,  25K languages and dialects, and  200K subdistricts) as well as translations between these categories across over two thousand datasets.   SocioMaps tools help users: (1) explore contextual information about specific sociopolitical categories, (2) translate and share categories from new datasets, standards, and published studies, (3) merge novel combinations of datasets for researchers custom research needs, and (4) document key aspects of the analytical workflow that often go unreported and will make analyses more reproducible.

SocioMaps capabilities will spur new interdisciplinary research, encourage new analyses of publicly funded data and re-assessments of the robustness and reproducibility of past findings. It will also create a foundation for future work with other kinds of entities (e.g. political parties, non-governmental organizations, industry and occupation classifications, and firms) and for reconciling sociopolitical entities over longer historical periods.   The project has led to the following training outcomes: One graduate student has received training in database and user interface development. Over the course of the grant, more than 100 undergraduates have received training in cross-cultural analysis, with over 40% under-represented minorities. Six of these undergraduates have received training in research methods and theories to complete independent student-driven projects. A number of these students have also gained experience presenting scientific results in lab meetings. Finally, in four workshops, our team has trained over 30 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty members in using CatMapper to enable comparative analyses.
