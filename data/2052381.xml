<AbstractNarration>This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in providing a novel, low-cost, scalable, and optimized-for-use-in-space solar panel technology based on ultrathin silicon solar cells. The developed space solar panels may have substantially lower cost compared to the state-of-practice space solar panels and will be compatible with automated high-volume manufacturing.  The panels will meet the requirements of the growing satellite manufacturing industry. The main customers include manufacturers of satellites for large scale satellite constellations and manufacturers of large-size spacecraft, as well as space agencies and private companies developing infrastructure for space, Moon and Mars exploration. Applications on Earth could include powering long-endurance drones (airplanes and airships) and remote facilities that need more compact and lighter weight solar solutions for off-grid power systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop novel space-stable and scalable packaging technologies for ultrathin silicon solar cells.  The project will develop a prototype solar blanket and demonstrate its integration into ultracompact solar array deployment systems.  Specific objectives of this Phase II project are to: (1) establish routine production of ultrathin silicon solar cells, (2) develop low-stress metal interconnects for thin silicon solar cells, (3) develop a cover glass replacement coating for thin silicon solar cells, (4) demonstrate mini-blankets with acceptable cell-to-module efficiency loss, (5) electrically and mechanically integrate silicon solar blanket, and (6) demonstrate deployment of the relevant size blanket while conducting preliminary stress testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Lowering the cost of rocket launch and advances in satellite manufacturing technology led to the emergence of several new space applications that require ten times more solar panels optimized for space than currently available on the market and at the price at least 10 times lower than currently available. These include: (1) large scale constellations of satellites in low Earth orbit used for telecommunication and surveillance; (2) orbital transfer vehicles that are designed to move other spacecraft in space; (3) future bases and water mining factories on the Moon and (4) space based solar power stations that will be generating electricity in orbit and beaming it down to Earth surface through the atmosphere to initially power remote consumers and eventually contributing to the renewable electricity mix.   The incumbent III-V multijunction solar cell technology that has been universally used to power all modern sacecraft since 2000s cannot meet this demand because: (1) extremely high manufacturing cost with minor cost reduction potential and (2) insufficient manufacturing capacity of III-V multijunction solar cells with several major barriers for scaling.    To meet the demand for more affordable and scalable space-stable solar panels Solestial is using already affordable and scalable silicon solar cell manufacturing technology while upgrading it to better work in space. The key innovation developed by Solestial is a silicon solar cell that can potentially achieve lower radiation induced degradation in space (where radiation induced defects is the major degradation mode of silicon based solar modules in space). This is achieved by making silicon solar cells extremely thin and by using defect engineering to enable low temperature annealing of radiation induced defects. In other words, we found that if silicon solar cell is made very thing and its bulk has the right combination of impurities it can self-heal radiation defects at operating conditions. But the next problem is how to package thin silicon solar cells into modules that can achieve overall low degradation rate, can be manufactured using automated production equipment, would not use expensive materials, have low mass and would be compatible with novel solar array deployment systems.   The main goal of this project was to develop a novel solar cell packaging technology that will possess all these features. The specific goals of this Phase 2 were to develop innovative interconnection and lamination methods for ultrathin silicon solar cells, develop a thin, flexible and affordable front transparent cover for solar cells to make flexible blankets, demonstrate a solar blanket manufactured using this novel technology, demonstrate the deployment of the developed blanket using innovative deployment mechanisms and achieve industry acceptance of Solestials solar cells and blankets by conducting stress testing in accordance with the qualification standard requirements and by flying the developed blankets in collaboration with the development partners.   During this Phase 2 project Solestial achieved all major goals set in 2021 and substantially improved the maturity of our solar blankets which allowed us to start the trials and demo flights with commercial customers. (1) We achieved 18% AM0 active area blanket efficiency, (2) established pilot production of solar blankets, (3) delivered solar blankets to 4 customers for demo flights and currently working on another 8 projects to fly in 2024, (4) signed over several hundred millions worth of Letters of Intent with commercial customers, (5) signed our first binding contract to deliver 20 kW of solar blankets, (6) leased or own manufacturing facility in Tempe, Arizona, fitted it as a clean room and started populating it with production equipment, (7) established a plan to start megawatt-scale production of solar cells and blankets already in mid 2024 to meet the demand of the satellite manufacturing industry.
