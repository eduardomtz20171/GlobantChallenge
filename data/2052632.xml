<AbstractNarration>Scientists have been studying many natural systems by viewing them as networks, a term used to describe collections of entities and their interactions. Networks are ubiquitous in many fields, including epidemiology, economics, sociology, genomics and ecology, to name a few. A number of statistical models have emerged over the last two decades to describe network data. One common type of model is the latent space model, where each entityâ€™s behavior is governed by its position in some unobserved (latent) space, and if we knew these positions, we could fully describe the statistical behavior of the network. While these models have been useful in many problems, real systems tend to be more complicated. The goal of this project is to fill this gap between models and reality by developing network analysis methods that still perform well even when the model does not fully match the data.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of this project are to improve our understanding of existing network analysis methods under model misspecification, heterogeneous noise, and incomplete or missing data, and to develop novel network methods that are robust to these sources of error.  We consider both these problems under one unified framework that represents the adjacency matrix of a network as its expectation plus entry-wise noise, which encompasses most popular network models.  Within this framework, the project will examine the effects of model misspecification on downstream inference, both for global inference tasks (e.g., network-level summary statistics) and local inference (e.g., node-level statistics). One core goal of the project is developing bootstrap and resampling algorithms for networks, two extremely useful tools in classical statistics that do not yet have full network analogues. Another core goal is developing more general notions of community membership and node similarity, allowing the extension of robust algorithms to a broader collection of network models. Finally, the methods developed will be extended to the analysis of multiple networks. Taken together, these tools will substantially expand the toolbox of network techniques, while accounting for the realities of noisy and incomplete network data and imperfect network models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The goal of this project was to understand the impacts of model misspecification in low-rank network models and develop tools that are robust to these misspecifications. Low-rank network models aim to describe collections of interacting entities (i.e., networks) as arising from unobserved low-dimensional geometric structure. In other words, we model the behavior of actors in a network as being described by points in low-dimensional Euclidean space. Co-PI Levin's work on this project focused on three main lines of research:   1) Resampling and uncertainty quantitification in low-rank network models   2) Understanding the fundamental limits of low-rank network models   3) Incorporating low-rank network models into standard statistical pipelines   Under research line (1), Co-PIs Levin and Levina continued to develop and extend their previous work on bootstrapping network data under low-rank models. An initial paper on this subject, co-authored by co-PIs Levin and Levina, is currently under revision at a top statistics journal, and accompanying statistical software is available through co-PI Levin's GitHub page. Co-PI Levin supervised a graduate project (currently under review at a top statistics journal) on resampling weighted networks and understanding how sensitive these methods are to the choice of edge-level noise distribution. Co-PI Levin supervised another graduate project (in preparation for submission) establishing how sensitive these resampling methods are to the choice of model rank, in line with the project's goal of understanding sensitivity to choice of model rank.   Under research line (2), Co-PI Levin supervised a series of papers aimed at establishing the minimax rate (i.e., the best possible accuracy one can obtain) for estimating low-rank network models. This line of research took the form of three papers, one of which has been accepted for presentation at NeurIPS 2024 and the other two of which are currently under review. This series of papers establishes the minimax rate for estimating low-rank structure in network models and has resulted in new statistical software for low-rank estimation that will be released alongside the publication at NeurIPS. In particular, the methods resulting from this largely theoretical work are largely agnostic to the edge-level distribution in the model. This aligns with the project's goal of developing network analysis methods that are robust to edge-level distribution. Further, the first of these papers yielded a novel algorithm for estimating the leading eigenvectors of a low-rank matrix observed subject to noise, a problem of importance in low-rank network modeling, but with applications in other areas including compressed sensing and principal components analysis.   Under research line (3), Co-PI Levin supervised a series of papers, co-authored with an NSF-supported graduate student, that aim to understand how low-rank network models can be incorporated into a fundamental statistical task: linear regression. In particular, these papers study problems related to network regression, in which we observe networks with responses associated to each entity in the network. For example, we might observe a measure of health associated to each person in a social network, and try to predict a person's health score from the scores of their neighbors. In one of these papers, accepted with minor revisions at a top statistics journal, Co-PI Levin and an NSF-supported graduate student developed a method for applying causal mediation analysis to the setting where a network plays the role of a mediator. In another of these papers (currently under review at a top statistics journal), it was shown that a certain widely-used network regression model called the linear-in-means model has a number of concerning statistical properties. Most importantly, under a range of conditions, the parameters of this model cannot be estimated accurately, rendering these models of limited utility in real-world settings. Finally, another of these papers (currently in preparation for submission) considers contagion, whereby behaviors or beliefs spread among pairs of interacting entities in a network, under low-rank network models. In particular, this paper models contagion as being driven by the unobserved low-rank structure, rather than by the observed network. This is in line with the project goal of developing robust methods: we rarely observe the true network that drives our data, but rather a noisy version of that network. This paper aims to account for that fact.   In addition to the above-described research projects and publicly-available statistical software, Co-PI Levin has organized a series of workshops and reading groups at University of Wisconsin-Madison related to network modeling. He has engaged in public outreach by speaking at the University of Wisconsin--Madison event Wednesday Night at the Lab, and by joining the Badger Talks program.
