<AbstractNarration>The goal of this doctoral dissertation research project is to use archaeological and paleoethnobotanical methods to investigate whether grand-scale geopolitical changes influenced local foodways during prehistory. The co-PI will study the effects of the growth of a regional market center and associated infrastructure on community agricultural practice and food security. This is an important step toward understanding political economies of subsistence goods. How did residents of small communities navigate their proximity to a market center and the construction of an adjacent monumental causeway? What can household food security strategies inform about the level of integration and dependence people experienced in food systems of the past? Paleoethnobotany, the study of ancient plant remains from archaeological contexts, provides a high resolution of data necessary to deduce household- and activity area-level patterns, allowing for greater understanding of interactions between local and regional phenomena. Ancient foodways are also relevant to discussions of heritage and identity in the present, in addition to applied dimensions of archaeological research on food security. In addition to training a doctoral student, the research will provide opportunities to exchange ideas with local community members about agriculture, foodways, and paleoethnobotany.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will be centered at a site along a monumental causeway that was built during the Late Classic period. The research asks, did the local household economy become embedded in the growing regional market economy, and if so, how did this affect food security? The co-PI will conduct excavations and collect paleoethnobotanical samples from agricultural and household spaces in order to understand patterns of plant species diversity in food production and consumption through time, in addition to resource access. Quantitative and qualitative data reflected in these patterns will elucidate whether the causeway became an avenue of access to new food resources, or, alternatively, undermined local control over food choice. More broadly the project will investigate local involvement in regional food systems, and how this was mediated by infrastructural projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over the course of 2021-2023, co-PI and PhD candidate Harper Dine investigated agricultural and household spaces at the ancient Maya sites of Yaxuna and Joya, located in central Yucat&aacute;n, Mexico, with a goal of understanding the relationships between local horticulture and foodways. As part of six months of archaeological excavation, Dine sampled soils and artifacts for microscopic and macroscopic plant remains. Some of these samples were from two large dry sinkholes known as rejolladas, in central locations within Yaxuna and Joya. It has long been posited that such features were used for agriculture in the past, as they have been found to support finnicky plants like cacao and are used by local Yucatec Maya speaking communities today. Other samples pertained to outer household areas where inhabitants likely deposited refuse and carried out day-to-day activities. In one of these contexts, a section of a previously-reported midden (refuse disposal area) that predated the associated household platform was encountered. This work was also supported by Fulbright and a Wenner-Gren Dissertation Fieldwork Grant.&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2023, Dine processed samples containing phytoliths&mdash;plant silica that forms in distinctive shapes indicative of various taxa and plant parts&mdash;at the McMaster Paleoethnobotanical Research Facility. Microscopy has revealed evidence plants in the palm, sunflower, bromeliad, dayflower, squash, sedge, arrowroot, and grass families, as well as achira and tentative evidence of the soursop and ginger families, hackberry, and a family of flowering and aromatic trees used for various types of incense (e.g., copal). These data support the presence of edible roots and fruit tree species, which, when interpreted in context with published ethnobotanical literature, have the potential to influence how we conceptualize use of these features in the past, and the role they played in the landscape of local agricultural practice.&nbsp;</p> <p>This DDRIG award has also supported microscopy related to the overall goals of the project, with included the analysis of a set of thirteen artifacts recovered previously from household excavations at Yaxuna and Coba, another Maya site to the east that is connected to Yaxuna by a long causeway. This work was done during the height of the pandemic and revealed starch evidence of bean and likely manioc on a stone grinding tool known as a bark beater, as well as a set of starches with damage similar to that resulting from fermentation on an obsidian blade.
