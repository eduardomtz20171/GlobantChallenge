<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on the use of combinatorial tools, such as orderings of numbers or algorithms for parking cars, to provide a more concrete understanding of abstract mathematical concepts in geometry and algebra.  In modern-day Schubert calculus, many questions in enumerative geometry - counting intersections of lines, planes, curves - have been translated into discrete combinatorial problems or algorithms that a computer can then analyze. The aim of this project is to come up with these types of combinatorial rules in related areas of geometry and algebra, in order to both increase computational efficiency and to make the geometric constructions more accessible to scientists in other disciplines.  The geometric spaces and algebraic structures that will be studied are of central importance to quantum physics and string theory. The project will involve graduate students in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will particularly focus on subvarieties and generalizations of flag varieties, Grassmannians, and moduli spaces of curves, all three of which are important geometric spaces whose cohomology rings are graded S_n-modules.  We aim to give combinatorial rules, in terms of Young tableaux, parking functions, and other combinatorial objects, that govern computational aspects of their cohomology rings, and use them to resolve open questions about the corresponding geometric spaces.  These new combinatorial rules also will be used to approach long-standing open problems in symmetric function theory, including the Macdonald positivity conjecture and the problem of determining equality of skew Schur Q functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The research in this project focused on the interplay between combinatorics, geometry, and representation theory. Specifically, the combinatorial study ofYoung tableaux, which are simple partial grids of numbers arranged in certain orders, ofpermutations, which are rearrangements of objects in a line, and oftrees, which are recursive loopless data structures, can all be used to understand and simplify deep concepts in the geometry ofGrassmannians,flag varieties, andmoduli spaces of curves.  One of the main results to come out of this project, by the PI, Griffin, and Levinson, was a proof of a conjectureby Monin and Rana on the moduli space M_0,n-bar of genus 0 curves with n marked points. Such a curve is, generically, a way of arranging n numbered beads around a circle (over the real numbers; or on a sphere, over the complex numbers), with special branching rules describing what happens when the beads collide. The space parameterizing all such curves, M_0,n-bar, has an embedding into a product of projective spaces, and the result gives a finite set of equations cutting out the embedding - essentially, ``graphing'' it in projective space with explicit polynomial formulas. The proof made heavy use of the combinatorics of trees.  Four additional papers on the combinatorics of M_0,n-bar resulted from this project, coauthored with various subsets of Cavalieri, Griffin, Levinson, and Monin. Each paper involved the combinatorics of trees, parking functions, or permutations to describe the geometric objects being studied.   Some similar combinatorial objects - such as Young tableaux - also arise naturally in therepresentation theoryof the symmetric group, which acts on thecohomology ringsassociated with manygeometric spaces. Representation theory is the study of representing an abstract algebraic object, such as a group, as a set of matrices whose multiplication respects the operation in the group. It is of interest to decompose such representations into irreducible representations, which correspond to Schur functionsin symmetric function theory.   A number of papers on Schur positivity and its implications in representation theory were published as a result of this grant. The PI gave a basis for generalizations of the cohomology ring of the flag variety that respects its decomposition into irreducible symmetric group representations. The PI and Griffin gave a Schur positive expansion of the Delta-Springer modules, which arise in geometry and representation theory. Most recently, the PI, Gorsky, and Griffin have developed a new geometric understanding of the Delta Conjecture, along with a new combinatorial proof of its known half.   Towards the project's broader impacts, the PI set up a virtual conferencing room in the CSU math department that anyone can use to give virtual talks or have virtual meetings, cutting down on the need for high-carbon-impact academic travel, and improving accessibility and instantaneous mathematical communication. The PI also widely disseminated her research results, including in her math blog, Mathematical Gemstones, which features posts written at a more understandable and accessible level than the publications.   The PI mentored four graduate students and one postdoc over the course of the project, served as head coach of the CSU Putnam team, and co-authored several papers with graduate students to aid both the project and the students' mathematical development. Adams, the PI, and Pries also published their co-authored Open Educational Resources textbook on combinatorics, Counting Rocks!, in the UMN Open Textbook Library, adding an accessible and affordable resource on the topic that can more widely communicate the core concepts.
