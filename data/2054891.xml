<AbstractNarration>The California bioscience sector employs more 300,000 skilled technicians, as well as at least an additional 600,000 related workers. Though the pandemic has negatively impacted many businesses across the state, the bioscience sector continues to expand, including efforts to develop, test, treat, and prevent COVID-19 infection. This project at Los Angeles Mission College focuses on two pressing needs: the acute industry demand for biotechnology lab assistants and technicians due to the pandemic, and the need of many individuals who lost their jobs to find new, sustainable employment. The demand for biotechnology workers has been growing for the past ten years, and the pandemic-driven demand for lab technicians, lab assistants and biotechnology technicians has only amplified it. At the same time, increased unemployment and job insecurity due to changing economic and social conditions are making displaced workers seek different, more sustainable employment options. The project aims to create a pathway for these individuals into biotechnology certification. With a focus on inclusion of veterans and individuals from communities that are underrepresented in STEM, the project aims to provide employment opportunities and increase the talent pool for a high demand, high growth sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will adapt the existing biotechnology certificates and Associate of Science degree programs and supplement these programs with new supports specifically to serve re-entering adult learners. The new supports will include a Bridge to Biotech workshop aimed at strengthening academic skills needed to succeed in science courses, and a Bridge to Employment workshop that prepares students for employment in the industry. Existing supports, such as tutoring, counseling, job readiness services, and industry internships will be modified to help adult students enter the workplace more quickly, while earning industry-recognized certifications along the way. The project will also conduct research and evaluation to determine how specific pathways, strategies, and activities affect participants’ success in completing the program and obtaining employment in biotechnology industry. The results are expected to increase knowledge about what works in retraining adults and helping them secure employment in the biotechnology industry. The project findings will be disseminated to a national audience to assist other organizations in creating pathways to technology careers for adults seeking reemployment. The project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation’s economy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The PI team has also made numerous presentations to the InnovATEBIO (NSF ATEs national center for biotechnology) network via Project Talks to share the results of PBL research.      PI Arora has presented nationally on the topic of using PBL in a biotechnology classroom. Link to the slides for Dr. Aroras 2022 National Career Pathways Network presentation: https://www.ncpn.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/arora-crossroads-slides.pdf   Survey responses indicate that students continue to find that the processes, resources, and opportunities put into place by the project team are critical in helping them to succeed in class and gain internships, experience, and employment. Industry field trips, class talks by former students, and extensive wrap-around support services emerge as the most important indicators and influencers of success.   All students also reported increased confidence in oral communication, written communication, working in a team, accepting direction and feedback, maintaining a professional work ethic, and lab etiquette.   After pandemic related challenges with recruitment in Year 1 due to the lack of in person events, the second and third years of the grant have seen an uptick of interest among students and the community. Moreover, dissemination efforts and the track record of near 100% student employment success attracted California state government interest and funding in the form of $2 million for STEM program expansion.

LA Mission College is the first college in LACCD to start a BS degree in Biomanufacturing. Here are some of the Supporting indicators:  Seven industry partners have committed to offer an interview to any student who completes the BioTC Certificate and earn the electronic badge. The Speaker Series offered every term included the PIs former students now working in the field which helps current students feel connected and imagine themselves in a similar role. PBL techniques used in this program are proven to be more effective for retaining and motivating adult learners. Partnership with the Amgen Biotech Experience (ABE) program that supports area high school teachers with free supplies for biotech classrooms. Six Bridge to Biotech and Bridge to Employment workshops have been offered since the start of funding. All are reviewed as extremely informative by students: both new to biotech and changing jobs/careers. Bridge to Employment workshops, all run by industry representatives with the opportunity for students to understand the field from a practitioners perspective.
