<AbstractNarration>Academic programs in Industrial Technology prepare students for employment in fields such as robotics, electronics, renewable energy, and battery technology, all of which have been identified as fast-growing and high-paying opportunities for an emerging skilled workforce.  The central Illinois region has identified an employment gap with more than 1000 unfilled positions for qualified workers with high-technology skills.  To help meet this need, Heartland Community College intends to make the Industrial Technology program more accessible to more students.   Specifically, it will revise and redesign the industrial technology courses for online instruction and offer laboratory experiences using an open-access laboratory model.  The open-access laboratory model will allow students to schedule and use industrial equipment and trainers during day, evening, or weekend hours, depending on their individual needs and time constraints.  In addition, the project will combine these curricular improvements with student supports, including supplemental instruction and peer mentoring.  The project expects that these improvements will increase the number of students completing the Industrial Technology program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to demonstrate a new model for industrial technology education using an open-access manufacturing laboratory, flexible content delivery, and student supports to enhance student access to high-quality Industrial Technology education.  To this end, Heartland Community College will dedicate 2500 square feet and additional college infrastructure to establish and maintain an open-access laboratory.  The space will be augmented with trained faculty, facilitators, and peer mentors to provide supportive human interactions.  The Industrial Technology faculty of Heartland Community College will revise their curriculum to allow for and support flexible learning formats that will compliment an open-access laboratory.  The college will also adopt a formal supplemental instruction model to give current students opportunities to become peer leaders, which will augment the leadersâ€™ learning as they help other students.  The flexible format will give students enhanced access to the laboratory and student support services, providing increased access for students with job and family obligations.  Heartland Community College will share their model through regional and national Career and Technical Education conferences.   This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Heartland revised curriculum to enable delivery of lecture/theory online or in-person and allow flexibility for the development of hands-on skills in the open-access industrial lab setting. The open lab allowed students to learn at their own pace according to their own schedules with the guidance of a faculty member, facilitator, or peer leader. Heartland deployed a modified version of the Supplemental Instruction (SI) model to enhance student learning by encouraging student interaction with fellow students, faculty, and peer mentors. The open access lab was initially made available daytime, nighttime, and weekend hours; however, weekend hours were eventually eliminated due to lack of student demand. Heartland&rsquo;s new model for hands-on technical instruction in which students can complete industrial technology courses in an online/open access format brought the flexibility students needed to balance work, life, and learning. The project scope included adapting six courses from the AAS Industrial Technology program to be offered in a flexible learning format; the six courses were:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>MAIN 101 Industrial &amp; Building Electricity&nbsp;</li> <li>MAIN 102 Mechanical Systems&nbsp;</li> <li>MAIN 201 Electrical Wiring and Maintenance&nbsp;</li> <li>MAIN 202 Fluid Power and Mechanical Systems&nbsp;</li> <li>MAIN 220 Mechatronics&nbsp;</li> <li>MAIN 222 Programmable Controllers&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p> <p class="paragraph">The format has been successful in several ways: (1) students are persisting to subsequent terms at a higher rate than students in traditional format classes and (2) the diversity of student ethnicity and gender has increased. During the two years of the project (Fall 2022 through Spring 2024) where these adapted courses were offered in a flexible format, Heartland had a 91% success rate for enrolled students. Additionally, the student age range for these courses expanded, with students from age 18 to 64 enrolling. Nearly 38 percent of students fell into the 25-34 range. Traditional in-person students are also supported by the FLITE model, offering the opportunity to use the open access lab for additional time/hands-on learning and instructor/peer interaction. Flexible learning formats within HCC&rsquo;s Industrial Technology programs and courses increase the number of students that begin, efficiently progress through, and complete Industrial Technology programs and courses.

The open access industrial technology lab format provides non-traditional students (and traditional students) a flexible option to earn credentials for diverse, local, in-demand, high-skill, high-wage jobs. As Heartland developed this model a deliberate effort was undertaken to strengthen the pipeline from K-12 to Heartland to the workplace. The overarching goal was to reduce and eliminate barriers to success for students, facilitating access to industrial technology programs while addressing industry demand for high-skill talent. Increased student interaction was a key component of this project&rsquo;s success; students work with each other and peer tutors, along with faculty, in the open access industrial technology lab. The one-on-one interaction meets students&rsquo; immediate needs and reinforces specific content.

Faculty/staff collaborate with students to ensure that they are successful in the specific course learning activity, the course itself, all classes within a semester, and the certification/degree program they are seeking.
