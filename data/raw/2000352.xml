<AbstractNarration>Operator algebras is a branch of mathematics that arose in the mathematical rigorization of quantum mechanics in the 1930s, and has since blossomed into an area touching many other parts of mathematics. The Graduate Summer School in Operator Algebras in Ottawa is an event that helps to inform and advance the careers of young researchers (primarily Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers). It consists of three lecture series delivered by renowned researchers in diverse areas of operator algebras, as well as a career talk and opportunities for participants to deliver short talks. Through these activities and networking opportunities, the summer school is designed to be very beneficial to the research program and the careers of the participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics of the lecture series are internationally relevant and timely, yet will be presented at a level that is accessible to the graduate student and postdoc participants. The topics are: (i) the classification of C*-algebras, with an emphasis on von Neumann algebra techniques, (ii) operator algebraic aspects of quantum information theory, and (iii) group amenability and its connections to operator algebras. This award supports the travel of US based Ph.D. students and post-docs to participate in this event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Today there are two main branches of operator algebras: C*-algebras, and von Neumann algebras.    Because the originally-planned school at the University of Ottawa was held online, due to the pandemic, funding was used to support a second school, rebranded as Kansas, not Ottawa, orKnottawa, and held at Kansas State University in July 2022.   The week-long school featured three mini-courses, the topics of which were selected from results of a survey of potential participants.

The mini-course lecturers were junior or mid-career researchers, among them one woman and one Hispanic mathematician. Each mini-course had approximately six hours of lecture.    In addition, participants had the opportunity to give brief 20-minute talks on their research; eight of them did this.   The school had two other activities: a panel of Knottawa participants spoke to the REU students at the KSU Math Department on graduate school; and two NSF Postdoctoral award fellows, one a Knottawa lecturer and the other a KSU member of faculty, spoke with the participants about that award.   All twelve attendees at the school were graduate students. Among them were seven non-majority gender (six women and one non-binary) participants and one Hispanic participant.
