<AbstractNarration>This project aims to advance national interests in health, prosperity, and welfare by educating high school students in technologies used in modern farming equipment and operations.  These technologies include geospatial technologies, robotics, electronics, sensors, and computer controls. The agricultural equipment industry has a significant shortage of qualified technicians trained to manufacture, use, and maintain modern equipment. To address this agricultural technician workforce gap, the project plans to develop a partnership among community college and secondary school faculty, and equipment manufacturers and dealers.  This partnership will collaborate to develop and implement a secondary school curriculum and faculty professional development initiative for technical agricultural education. The resulting courses will be designed for dual enrollment credit at high schools and colleges. Secondary students who complete the credential and earn college credit will be prepared to move seamlessly into an agricultural technician training program at partnering colleges or directly into the agricultural technician workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of the project is to build a secondary school agricultural technician program that focuses on skills and knowledge that are directly relevant and transferable to higher education and to agricultural technician careers. The partners, led by AgCentric at Central Lakes College and the Curriculum for Agricultural Science Education (CASE), include Northland Community and Technical College, Ridgewater College, and industry collaborators.  These partners will leverage their resources and experience to ensure this project meets industry, student, and faculty needs in agricultural technician education. The project intends to have a national reach, through developing course content that links agricultural science with complex mechanical systems. The curriculum will be written, field-tested, and revised following the CASE model, which is based on evidence and current pedagogical approaches. The project evaluation will measure the progress of curriculum development and implementation, hypothesized student outcomes of increased college and workforce preparation, and impacts on the agricultural technician workforce. A culminating feature of this project will be the development of an industry-recognized credential that will help further the college, career, and workforce aspirations of secondary and post-secondary students. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The project aimed to develop a capstone-level agricultural technician curriculum for career and technical educators to implement at secondary schools. The curriculum would align with the ag technician training at two-year institutions and industry, preparing students for college and career success. The curriculum and professional development programming were developed with post-secondary faculty from partnering colleges in collaboration with CASE 4 Learning and industry experts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The NSF grant (<strong>2000787</strong>) was awarded in 2020 to AgCentric at Central Lakes College, with CASE 4 Learning (Curriculum for Agricultural Science Education) from the National Council for Agricultural Education as a key nonprofit partner. Additional partners included Ridgewater College and Northland Community and Technical College.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Impacts</strong></p> <p>A <strong>curriculum development team</strong> from CASE, partnering colleges at AgCentric, secondary career, and technical education programs, and industry developed a credit-bearing, technical skills-based curriculum preparing secondary students to become technicians in the agricultural field and <em>leading to concurrent enrollment in post-secondary schools.</em> The curriculum development committee identified the skills, competencies, materials, resources, and supplies to support the CASE curriculum writing team. CASE worked with post-secondary faculty to develop hands-on interactive activities where students could practice skills and demonstrate competencies set by industry. As part of the curriculum development, secondary school instructors used preliminary lessons in the classroom and provided feedback to the CASE writing team. Upon completion, the curriculum consisted of 180 days of curricular instruction focused on technician service, powertrain, electrical, precision agriculture, diesel technology, and fluid power skills. Feedback during the grant identified a need for additional safety instruction. AgCentric worked with CASE to apply for and receive supplemental funds to develop a Safety Module to supplement the curriculum where needed.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>CASE worked with AgCentric and college faculty to develop and implement a <strong>comprehensive professional development program</strong> to train teachers to use the curriculum to prepare their students for industry work and post-secondary enrollment. CASE and post-secondary faculty identified key competencies and training needed for teachers. The CASE team collaborated with post-secondary faculty to develop a 60-hour professional development program. After writing the professional development plan and field testing it the first year, CASE and post-secondary faculty prepared secondary teachers from the first cohort to instruct teachers during the next professional development held during the third year of the grant. This NSF project funded materials and professional development for 53 teachers during the grant. Supplementary grant dollars partially funded additional teachers throughout the duration of the grant. CASE has used its sustainability model to continue to offer professional development beyond the supplementary grant. Currently, 114 secondary teachers use the curriculum in their classrooms.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Student preparedness for work in the industry was significantly increased </strong>by the diligent work provided by industry representatives from the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), Equipment Dealers Association (EDA), and Associated Equipment Distributors who collaborated with AgCentric and CASE throughout this project. These organizations provided a breadth and depth of knowledge of applied agriculture technology and secured project resources, including material support for local schools and sponsorships for teachers attending professional development. In addition, all schools with teachers attending the professional development from this project are eligible to become <em>Associated Equipment Distributor Foundation (AEDF) Recognized High Schools</em>. Furthermore, the <em>Associated Equipment Distributor Foundation (AEDF) Recognized High School </em>program connects regional industries in the technician field with high schools to enhance student lab and work experiences. Finally, AEDF has an assessment process to assess student technician skill competency. Students enrolled in a high school course utilizing the curriculum from this project are eligible to take the skills assessment and be recognized by AEDF.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Merit</strong></p> <p>CASE and AgCentric have disseminated the model at national NSF and Career and Technical Education conferences. CASE has incorporated the curriculum into its Agricultural Mechanics and Engineering curricular area so that schools can use the capstone-level course for a student's chosen program of study. The title of the curriculum is <em>Agricultural Equipment and Maintenance Technology</em>. CASE has worked with the Associated Equipment Distributors to align the curriculum with their industry standards. This alignment has had a direct impact on industry-school connections.</p> <p>The TAA project has addressed a documented shortage of agricultural technicians nationwide.
