<AbstractNarration>The fourth Industrial Revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, is already transforming the way companies create products. One consequence of Industry 4.0 is the integration of new technologies into manufacturing processes. Examples of these technologies include the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), autonomous robots, and cyber-physical systems.  Given the rapidly changing tools and processes, manufacturers nationwide often struggle to find technicians with the skills needed in these new work environments. An especially critical need exists for qualified automation/robotics technicians.  This project aims to address this urgent need in advanced manufacturing by educating technicians who have mechanical skills, together with knowledge of and skills in emerging robotic technologies. Working with industry and educational partners, Stark State College plans to improve training of automation and robotics technicians who will meet current and future industry demands. Potential societal benefits of this project include an updated, industry-aligned automation/robotics curriculum; a stackable technician educational pathway with lower time to degree; development of low-cost training units that simulate advanced manufacturing environments; and a professional development model to better prepare instructors to train tomorrow's automation/robotics technicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project include increasing capacity to effectively train automation/robotics technicians, improving the quality of technician education by better aligning it to workforce needs, and expanding awareness of advanced manufacturing careers among high school students and thus increase participation in automation/robotics programs at both secondary and postsecondary levels. The project aims to achieve these goals by: 1) updating the automation/robotics program curriculum to include training on Industry 4.0 technologies, such as IIoT; 2) creating a new IIoT-focused educational pathway to support student recruitment and retention from high school through associate degree completion; 3) developing low-cost training units to complement the new pathway and curriculum; 4) conducting IIoT boot camps and workshops to engage high school students; and 5) providing professional development to high school and college faculty to grow teaching proficiency and encourage curriculum adoption. Project deliverables and outcomes will be disseminated through regional and national meetings, publications, and webinars or other online mechanisms. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Outcomes:   Outcome for Goal 1: Using funding provided by this grant, the college was able provide training for a second faculty on the FANUC robot HandlingTool Operations and Programming course.This increased our instructional capacity in the Automation and Robotics area. The name of this course is AIT220, Industrial Robotics, at Stark State College.      Outcome for Goal 2: A new 3 credit hour course was developed called AIT121, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This course incorporates IIoT and I4.0 technologies into the Automation and Robotics program. The incorporation of this course into the program increases the quality of the training by providing current and future students with knowledge of these new technologies that will help local businesses to compete globally in the high tech manufacturing field.    A key part of this new IIoT course was the creation of an extremely low cost, quality easy to use trainer that provides the student with hands-on activities to re-enforce the topics covered in the lecture and excite passion for this new technology. The original idea was to create a marble machine to sort marbles based on color using vision technology. This marble machine trainer is still under development due to some unexpected technical challenges that we are working through. The physical structure of the marble machine was created using 3D printing technology and is currently being refined. During the development of the marble machine, a simpler training board was created using a Beaglebone controller mounted on a board with various sensors and actuators. It has been determined for individual labs that this board is more practical for most of the hands-on lab activities due to its flexibility.This training board has been used extensively in the AIT121 course (Industrial Internet of Things) as well as for the boot camp, profession development day, and high school workshops that were conducted as part of this grant. This board is continually being used for these purposes and will continue to be used even though the grant has ended.      Outcome for Goal 3: Enrollment in the Automation and Robotics program increased significantly in part due to the increased awareness from the two student boot camps as well as the one-day student workshops as well as the instructor professional development workshops. Overall local awareness and workforce need in the automation and robotics area also aided in the enrollment increase. Specifically, enrollment in the AIT220, Industrial Robotics course during the Fall 2024 semester required the addition of a second course section increasing fall enrollment from a typical 14-16 students to 32 students.

Increased overall career awareness and value was generated by Stark State College creating a Learn to Earn pathway in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This allowed for a creation of a new credit career enhancement certificate that incorporates nationally recognized industry certifications that can be earned in the areas of robotics and networking embedded within it.      Outcome for Goal 5: The grant outcomes, best practices, and trainer designs were presented by the PI at the High Impact Technology Exchange Conference (HI-TEC) 2024 conference in July 2024 to interested conference attendees. These outcomes were also presented to the grant advisor board members.     Last Modified: 10/26/2024       Submitted by: RichardLHartmann]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
