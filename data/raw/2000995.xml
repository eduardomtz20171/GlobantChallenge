<AbstractNarration>Part I: Non-technical description: &lt;br/&gt;Predicting how polar ice sheets will respond to future global warming is difficult because all the processes that contribute to their melting are not well understood. This is important because the more ice on land that melts, the higher sea levels will rise. The most significant uncertainty in current estimates of sea-level rise in the coming decades is the potential contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. One way to increase our knowledge about how large ice sheets respond to climate change in response to natural factors is to examine the geologic past. Natural global warming (and cooling) events in Earth’s history provide examples that we can use to better understand processes, interactions, and responses we can’t directly observe today. One such time period, approximately three million years ago (known as the Pliocene), was the last time atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were as high as they are today and, therefore, represents a time period to study to better understand the ice sheet response to a warming climate. Specifically, this project is interested in understanding how ocean currents near Antarctica, which transport heat and store carbon, behaved during these past climate events. The history of past ice sheet-ocean interactions are recorded in sediments that were deposited, layer upon layer, in the deep sea offshore Antarctica. In January-February 2018, a team of scientists and crew set sail to the Ross Sea, offshore west Antarctica, on the scientific ocean drilling vessel JOIDES Resolution to recover such sediment archives. This project focuses on a sediment core from that expedition, which captures the relatively warm Pliocene time interval, as well as the subsequent transition into cooler climates typical of the past two million years. The researchers will analyze the sediment with multiple complementary measurements, including: grain size, composition, chemistry of organic matter, physical structures, microfossil type and abundance, and more. These analyses will be done by the research team, including several students, at their respective laboratories and will then integrated into a unified record of ice sheet-ocean interactions. Ultimately, the results will be used to improve modeled projections of how the Antarctic Ice Sheet could respond to future climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Part II: Technical description: &lt;br/&gt;Geological records from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) margin demonstrate that the ice sheet oscillated in response to orbital variations in insolation (i.e., ~400, 100, 41, and 20 kyr), and it appears to be more sensitive to specific frequencies that regulate mean annual insolation (i.e., 41-kyr obliquity), particularly when the ice sheet extends into marine environments and is impacted by ocean circulation. However, the relationship between orbital forcing and the production of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is unconstrained. Thus, a knowledge gap exists in understanding how changing insolation impacts ice marginal and Southern Ocean conditions that directly influence ventilation of the global ocean. The researchers hypothesize that insolation-driven changes directly affected the production and export of AABW to the Southern Ocean from the Pliocene through the Pleistocene. For example, obliquity amplification during the warmer Pliocene may have led to enhanced production and export of dense waters from the shelf due to reduced AIS extent, which, in turn, led to greater AABW outflow. To determine the relationship of AABW production to orbital regime, they plan to reconstruct both from a single, continuous record from the levee of Hillary Canyon, a major conduit of AABW outflow, on the Ross Sea continental rise. To test their hypothesis, they will analyze sediment from IODP Site U1524 (recovered in 2018 during International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 374) and focus on three data sets. (1) They will use the occurrence, frequency, and character of mm-scale turbidite beds as a proxy of dense-shelf-water cascading outflow and AABW production. They will estimate the down-slope flux via numerical modeling of turbidity current properties using morphology, grain size, and bed thickness as input parameters. (2) They will use grain-size data, physical properties, XRF core scanning, CT imaging, and hyperspectral imaging to guide lithofacies analysis to infer processes occurring during glacial, deglacial, and interglacial periods. Statistical techniques and optimization methods will be applied to test for astronomical forcing of sedimentary packages in order to provide a cyclostratigraphic framework and interpret the orbital-forcing regime. (3) They will use bulk sedimentary carbon and nitrogen abundance and isotope data to determine how relative contributions of terrigenous and marine organic matter change in response to orbital forcing. All of these data will be integrated with sedimentological records to deconvolve organic matter production from its deposition or remobilization due to AABW outflow as a function of the oscillating extent of the AIS. These data sets will be integrated into a unified chronostratigraphy to determine the relationship between AABW outflow and orbital-forcing scenarios under the varying climate regimes of the Plio-Pleistocene.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research studied sediment collected from below the seafloor in the Ross Sea, Antarctica during the International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 374 aboard the research ship <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> in 2018 (Figure 1). The sediment was deposited on the seafloor over the past 4 million years. It consists of the fossil remains of organisms living in the ocean (mostly microscopic algae called diatoms) and rock pieces that come from the Antarctic continent and are dropped on the seafloor by melting icebergs or ocean currents. We studied the changes in the sediment composition and what that tells us about the size of the Antarctic Ice Sheet and associated ocean circulation over the past 4 million years. This period spans a change in Earth&rsquo;s climate from a warmer time before 3 million years ago to the formation of large ice sheets in the Arctic region of the Northern Hemisphere about 2.7 million years ago. These Northern Hemisphere ice sheets grew and shrank in size every approximately 40,000 years. Then, about 800,000 years ago, the ice sheets started to last longer, resulting in periods of growth and shrinkage of the ice sheets of about 100,000 years (more than twice as long as the previous 40,000-year cycles).</p> <p>Our results show distinct changes in the Antarctic Ice Sheet associated with each phase. During the warmer Pliocene before the growth of large ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere between 4 and 2.7 million years ago, the Ross Sea sediment is mostly made up of the fossils of marine algae (diatoms) that suggest the Antarctic Ice Sheet was smaller, probably because warmer water regularly made its way close to the continent, and there was very little sea ice covering the Ross Sea during summers (panel C in Figure 2). There is a distinct change in the sediment composition starting at 2.7 million years ago, with fewer fossils and more rock fragments that range in size from microscopic to sand and gravel size. We interpret this to mean that when large ice sheets formed in the Northern Hemisphere, the Antarctic Ice Sheet also got larger and there was more sea ice in the Ross Sea that did not melt very much during the summers (panel B in Figure 2). Finally, there is another change that happened at about the same time that the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets started to last for a longer period at about 800,000 years ago. In the Antarctic, the sediment deposited over the last 800,000 years sometimes contains more fossils of marine algae (diatoms) and another group of organisms called foraminifera that make their shells out of carbonate (like shells one might pick up on a beach). The presence of the carbonate-shelled foraminifera suggests that warmer waters were sometimes present in the Ross Sea, which helped to melt the Antarctic Ice Sheet and resulting in a short period of time when the Antarctic Ice Sheet was smaller in size before it started getting larger again (panel A in Figure 2). The results of this research show that there are clear linkages between climate in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres over the last 4 million years and that the regular presence of warmer ocean water next to Antarctica resulted in a smaller Antarctic Ice Sheet with reduced sea ice. This has implications for future warming due to human-caused climate change.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This research supported four undergraduate students (3 female and two from other underrepresented communities) who assisted with collecting data for this project. Two continued in Antarctic research, starting MS programs at the University of Houston and Texas A&amp;M University. Additionally, this project supported one female PhD student who included a chapter from this project in her dissertation. We also tested a new methodology with these sediment cores, using a type of camera that can see more than just visible light to look for different minerals. This work is ongoing, but a result is that the <em>JOIDES Resolution</em> Science Operator at Texas A&amp;M University has developed a new instrument to image seafloor sediment cores with this type of camera.

Finally, we held three polar sediment summer schools for students and early career scientists: two at Texas A&amp;M University in 2019 and 2024, and one at Oregon State University in 2022. These schools trained more than 80 early career scientists from the United States and elsewhere in research using sediments collected from the Antarctic and Arctic (including Canada, the USA, and Greenland).
