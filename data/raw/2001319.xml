<AbstractNarration>Birational geometry is a classical mathematical discipline whose roots go back to ancient Greece. Nevertheless, it still offers many difficult unsolved questions. The core part of this project is to tackle these questions with cutting-edge modern methods coming from the homological mirror symmetry program. Homological mirror symmetry is a deep geometric duality that originates in quantum field theory and has been used in studying novel phenomena and proving unexpected results in symplectic geometry suggested by algebraic geometry. This project aims to use homological mirror symmetry to introduce new applications of symplectic topology to algebraic geometry and to answer classical open questions in birational geometry. A postdoctoral fellow will be involved in various aspects of this research project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use an approach based on categorical KÃ¤hler geometry. The most notable application of this approach is toward proving the non-rationality of generic, four-dimensional cubics, which is arguably the central problem in algebraic geometry. More specifically, a detailed study of the singularities of quantum D-modules produces a completely new type of birational invariant. This new invariant is a canonical decomposition of the cohomology of a four-dimensional cubic based on simultaneous use of both (algebraic and symplectic) sides of homological mirror symmetry. The example of four-dimensional cubics is only the tip of the iceberg. There are many other potential applications of this approach, for example to uniformization problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Categorical Kaehler Geometry is a new subject initiated by Kontsevich, Katzarkov and their collaborators.    The idea of studying structures by finding representatives of that structure that extremize a certain quantity is extremely robust, and consequently ubiquitous in mathematics. It is the basis for some of the deepest theorems in mathematics -- it constitutes the basis for Hodge theory and Hamilton's Ricci flow program, for example. The program we propose derives from the observation that the key features of the Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau extremization problem are sufficiently robust to allow one to extend the DUY theorem to the context of categorical noncommutative geometry. In the categorical realm, this is an interplay between categories and stability conditions.   Our considerations lead to several new directions in modern geometry:   1. Spectral networks and connection with Hitchin's systems.  2. New singularity theory - singularity theory in categorical setting.  3. New type of spectra and applications.  4. Connections with Birational Geometry.   5. We initiated the theory of atoms.  6. We made a connection with Topological modular forms.    The results obtained were very well broadcasted at IMSA conferences in Lecture series by Konstevich.   As a result new collaborations have been initiated and papers and lectures notes are being written. New results were reported at conferences.  The training of students and postdocs was a major part of this project. The participation of  the underrepresented groups was given special attention.  Massive effort was made to arrange international collaboration with Latin America - the main function of IMSA.         Last Modified: 07/13/2024       Submitted by: LudmilVKatzarkov]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
