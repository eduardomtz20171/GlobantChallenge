<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project comprised of ten awards will integrate information about bryophytes and lichens, with each other and with their commensal organisms, including fungi, on a worldwide scale. Bryophytes and lichens are functionally related as the main hosts for cryptobiotic communities forming minute "forests" that provide a matrix of habitats for many microscopic organisms, including tardigrades, mites, rotifers, micro-mollusks, microalgae, microfungi, and prokaryotes. These communities have global relevance and perform essential functions on our planet, for example, the biological soil crusts that harbor these communities form a "living skin" covering approximately 12% of  Earth's terrestrial surface.  In addition, professional training will be provided for a large number of undergraduates, with a focus on leveraging local resources to promote underrepresented students in STEM fields.  Students will be trained in digitization and collections management, and will contribute to the education and public outreach components of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this collaboration, twenty-five US herbaria will image and digitize associated metadata for almost 1.2 million bryophyte and lichen herbarium specimens held in US institutions. Imaging the physical specimens of these organisms and integrating data from comparative genomics, nucleotide sequence data, and other resources is unprecedented on this scale. These integrated data will form a critical resource for evolutionary and ecological studies, that may, in turn, lead to a deeper understanding of (1) how biocrusts perform their ecosystem functions, (2) the roles of bryophytes and lichens in carbon/nitrogen cycling, (3) the dynamic evolution of symbioses in space and time, (4) the historical and contemporary drivers of endophyte co-diversification, and (5) the evolution of biodiversity using spatial phylogenetics. Deep-learning approaches using repurposed digital images may also provide powerful new investigative tools.  Digitized data will be shared with iDigBio.org and other repositories.  A multi-pronged approach to broader impacts spans from K-12 to participatory citizen science initiatives.  These include (1) diverse digital, interactive, and object-based learning outreach programs; (2) online lesson plans; (3) science youth groups; (4) Science Clubs and public educator workshops; and (5) a series of videos using Learning Glass â€“ which collapses the perspectives of viewer and presenter into one shared perspective. In addition, the PIs and collaborating institutions will host WeDigBio and K-12 clubs hosting label transcription crowdsourcing events during the award period. The project also partners with Zooniverse, leaders in online citizen science, where we will develop an online platform for citizen scientists to make observations on character traits that can then enhance metadata not always on the scientific label data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

We were able to barcode a total of 61.615 bryophyte and 68,084 new lichen specimens. This meant we were able to complete the barcoding of our general lichen collection. The bryophyte records generated include the entirety of the general hepatic collection, and the first twenty families of mosses in the herbarium. We were able to image a total of 102,511 specimens, more than our initial goal, but not everything we barcoded, since we also were capturing images of specimens previously barcoded but not imaged. Because the imaging of collections where we have multiple packets mounted on the same sheet was a slower process than we initially estimated, we focused more time on imaging to be able to generate images for transcription by future staff and volunteers. Because of this, we were only able to transcibe 64,726 records. In the time period of the project, 29,254 sites related to these objects were georeferenced. The bulk of the digitization work was performed by two Lead Digitizers and six student interns. These project staff received professional dvelopment training in herbarium curation best practices and digitization protocols, the use of our collections management system, data entry standards, use of photography equipment, and other herbarium tasks. Additionaly, they attended numerous seminars and tours by NYBG staff withing Science, Conservation, Horticulture and Humanities.
