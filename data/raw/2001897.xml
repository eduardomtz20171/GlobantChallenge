<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2020 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Benjamin Gammage is " Mirror symmetry and Langlands duality." The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University the sponsoring scientist is Denis Auroux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  In this project, I used recent developments in the theory of microlocal sheaves to understand the combinatorial underpinnings of the homological mirror symmetry conjecture, with applications to representation theory and cluster theory. Some particular developments included:   Cluster theory:Cluster algebras are algebraic structures governed by a simple combinatorial rule. Together with Ian Le, and in further work, I showed how these rules arise naturally in symplectic geometry, which should pave the way for future geometric approaches to cluster theory.   3d mirror symmetry:Together with Justin Hilburn and Ian Le, I initiated the homological 3d mirror symmetry program, which studies boundary conditions for 3-dimensional topological quantum field theories arising from gauge theory.

Our results have laid the ground for an entirely new field of study, with connections to recent developments in geometric representation theory and higher category theory.   Training graduate students:I taught topics courses for graduates on my research in quantum field theory and microlocal sheaf theory, and mentored graduate students in applying tools from these fields in their own research.
