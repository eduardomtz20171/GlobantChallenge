<AbstractNarration>This project aims to provide high-quality, long-term records of past streamflow in the Lower Missouri River (LMR) basin by integrating select gage records, modeled hydrology, and several complementary dendrochronology reconstruction approaches focusing on water-year and seasonal generation of runoff and the improved capture of extremes. This project seeks to: (1) incorporate gage data, estimates of natural flow, and modeled hydrology to develop streamflow calibration series; (2) generate reconstructions of streamflow for key sub-basin gages in the LMR, along with spatial reconstructions of runoff for the basin; (3) evaluate multi-century synoptic climate controls on LMR flow within a broader North American context; and (4) analyze the impact of warming temperatures on future flow patterns.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extreme events (floods and droughts) have been common in the LMR over the past several decades, but the context for understanding the long-term hydroclimate variability impacting flow is limited due to a paucity of long streamflow records that are unaffected by human modification.  The LMR basin is one of the few remaining major river systems in the U.S. lacking streamflow reconstructions in large part due to the scarcity of reliable instrumental data for flow calibration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) include an improved baseline understanding of droughts/floods/pluvials in the Lower Missouri River Basin and the involvement of stakeholders at all levels including water resource managers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Lower Missouri River Basin (LMRB) is a critical region for food production, water supply, navigation, and wildlife habitats. Climate variability and change pose significant challenges in this region, which has been experiencing increases in streamflow and frequent extreme events (floods and droughts) over the past several decades. Prior to this project, the LMRB was one of the few remaining major river systems in the U.S. that lacked long-term records of streamflow, which meant that we were not able to place recent conditions within a longer-term context. There were major challenges to providing these long-term records, including both limited unhindered streamflow data and limited tree-ring records.</p> <p>This project filled this information gap by providing reconstructions of streamflow in the Lower Missouri River, with a focus on the Hermann, MO, gage, near the mouth of the river. We first updated tree-ring chronologies in seven states in the central U.S. by conducting field and lab work to extend tree-ring records that we identified as important for this work up through the present day. We reprocessed over 1000 existing tree-ring chronologies using state-of-the-art tree-ring methods designed to correct for human disturbance effects, an important factor in the Missouri River Basin. We did extensive work to compare estimated unregulated flow records from the U.S. Army Core of Engineers (which have the effects of dams and diversions removed) with modeled hydrology in order to provide the best possible streamflow records. We then tested a variety of reconstruction methods and produced a record of Lower Missouri River streamflow back to 1360 CE.</p> <p>As part of this project, it was important to understand the drivers of variability in this river system over time. We used both instrumental and model data to disentangle the factors influencing streamflow trends, including land use changes, climate variability, and anthropogenic climate change. We studied how the Great Plains Low-Level Jet influences precipitation and streamflow in the central U.S., both over the past several centuries with a reconstruction of the wind and moisture components of the Jet back to 1690 CE, and into the future using climate model projections. We were able to integrate our new Lower Missouri River flow reconstruction with a previous reconstruction of the Upper Missouri River to better understand the connections between the different regions of the large Missouri River Basin and how they interact over time and space. Combined results from these research areas show the enormous amount of variability in these systems over multiple centuries. We found that moisture transport into this region is projected to increase in the future, with important implications for precipitation, streamflow, and flooding.</p> <p>Beyond these scientific contributions, this project has broader implications for science and society.&nbsp;The methods developed through this project will be more widely applicable to other studies that are hindered by sparse or inadequate data, a common issue in paleoclimate studies. Through this project, we have increased understanding of the drivers of high-flow events that can lead to flooding in the Missouri River Basin, and how these drivers might change in the future. This project involved direct engagement with resource managers through meetings and workshops, with the aim of producing past reconstructions and future projections that can be used as input into operational river system models. Our research is relevant to resource professionals currently dealing with and anticipating water-related management challenges, both at the basin scale and at the federal level. This project involved the education and training of students in hands-on research experiences, helping to develop the next generation of scientists.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 10/24/2024<br> Modified by: Erika&nbsp;K&nbsp;Wise</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002259/2002259_10660949_1729016267449_Floods--rgov-214x142.PNG" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002259/2002259_10660949_1729016267449_Floods--rgov-800width.PNG" title="Unusually high integrated water vapor transport (IVT) and Great Plains Low-Level Jet (GPLLJ) events preceded the 1993 Missouri River Basin floods"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002259/2002259_10660949_1729016267449_Floods--rgov-66x44.PNG" alt="Unusually high integrated water vapor transport (IVT) and Great Plains Low-Level Jet (GPLLJ) events preceded the 1993 Missouri River Basin floods"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Unusually high integrated water vapor transport (IVT; light gray bars) and Great Plains Low-Level Jet events (teal circles) shown in the two months leading up to the extreme Missouri River flooding in late July, 1993.
