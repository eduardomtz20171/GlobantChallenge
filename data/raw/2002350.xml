<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by creating active learning exercises that help students learn abstract concepts in mechanical engineering.  The project focuses specifically on concepts related to vibrations and control.  Learning abstract concepts can be enhanced through guided explorations that involve real world phenomena. Such explorations often occur in the laboratory, where students use special equipment to explore applications of the concepts. Unfortunately, engineering laboratory equipment is not usually portable for use outside of the lab and can be expensive.  This project will develop 3D printed laboratory devices that support student learning of mechanical engineering concepts and that are also inexpensive, compact, modular, and portable.  The devices can be used in the laboratory, but also in classroom demonstrations and at home.  Analogous to engaging in undergraduate research experiences, an undergraduate Research Design Group will plan, print, and evaluate the new devices.  Thus, undergraduates will be involved in design and production of laboratory devices that are intended to support the learning of other students.  The devices will be bundled with ready-to-use learning activities designed using a learning sciences approach.  An online repository containing device plans and associated learning activities will enable other engineering programs to adopt this approach. The results of this project may present a new approach for improving engineering education while decreasing the cost of education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to improve student learning in core mechanical engineering courses, namely, dynamics, vibrations, machine design, and control theory. The devices and classroom activities will be designed by adapting Hanson’s Activity Design Methodology and will focus on demonstrating fundamental concepts of vibrations such as natural frequency, free response to an initial disequilibrium condition, and forced response to an external input applied to a system. The project will address two research questions: (1) What types of devices will enhance student learning by measuring key physical behaviors of mechanical, electrical, and electromechanical systems? (2) What is the impact on learning for students using these devices in classroom learning activities and for the students who design these devices? Student learning and professional outcomes will be assessed in lecture and laboratory courses, comparing the results of students who used the devices in the learning activities to a control group that did not have the learning activities.  Student learning will be assessed using exam questions, homework, and reflective writing. Students’ professional development will be assessed using established instruments for growth mindset, motivation, and engineering identity. Given the low cost of producing these devices, this approach could be widely adopted in the mechanical engineering education community to improve student learning. This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources Program, which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

These devices include a compliant (flexible) parallel arm; compliant (flexible) oscillator/resonator; translational vibration system for movement in one direction; a set of pendulum devices including a single degree of freedom (DOF) pendulum (rotates about a single point), 3 DOF pendulum (multiple connected points of rotation), a controlled pendulum (to specify a desired trajectory for rotation); a rotating device with an unbalanced mass; and a disturbance control system. These devices were specifically designed to demonstrate the fundamentals of theory for dynamics, vibrations, and controls within their associated laboratories. Images of the developed lab equipment are attached as figures. Moreover, the project's impact extends beyond the design of lab equipment. When the pandemic caused widespread school closures and disruptions in higher education, forcing a shift to online teaching and learning, not all institutions were able to provide sufficient resources and technology. &nbsp;This led to inequalities in access to learning materials, particularly in engineering labs. To address this issue, we developed open-source virtual simulations for vibrations, control theory, and lab courses that are developed in MATLAB Simscape. The developed lab equipment was integrated into the curriculum as hands-on lab activities for students enrolled in vibrations and control laboratories. Additionally, the portable lab equipment were utilized for in-class demonstrations with students enrolled in mechanical vibrations and control theory courses.</p> <p>The project also produced intellectual merit through designs for learning activities paired with each developed lab equipment. The learning activity designs are adapted from the POGIL approach (Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning) from Process Education. The learning activities begin with a discussion of ungraded pre-lab questions related to the theory associated with each lab to help students recall concepts learned in the pre-requisite courses such as mechanical vibrations. These preliminary questions helped students uncover important gaps in prerequisite knowledge such as how to determine the fundamental frequency for a system, which concepts are required to determine the damping coefficient for a system, etc. Also, the learning objectives and performance criteria align with the instructions, such that what students are asked to do constructively aligns with the goals for the learning outcomes and learning process. Next, undergraduate research assistants who designed and developed the 3D-printed lab equipment presented their systems in the laboratories. Finally, student teams (3-4 members) completed the learning activity using the equipment while the instructor and the lab assistant were available to constructively intervene as needed. The instructions students followed during this phase included highlighting relevant vocabulary, supporting information, and models needed to complete the hands-on learning exercise to collect and analyze data from the 3D-PLE device. Finally, each learning activity includes a series of critical thinking questions. These questions reinforce important factual elements of the learning, require convergent thinking to integrate ideas from the learning, and require divergent thinking to expand student thinking toward new contexts, potential issues, or future research. Each activity ends with a brief reflection or self-assessment.</p> <p>Results show strong learning gains across each element of the seven 3D-PLE learning activities. For example, among 188 students who used the pendulum device, 80% perceived improved support for their learning in all categories of assignment design and engineering skills development. Over half of the students felt confident that they could demonstrate the learning objectives on their own or could even teach it to someone else in all but one case.<strong> </strong>Additionally, focus groups with students show they felt the learning activities were highly supportive of their learning in several important ways such as amount of hands-on involvement, development of deep understanding, and how the learning activities provided the opportunity to try, fail, and try again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>PIs recruited minority and female students in their research group. This approach is consistent with research showing that creativity and healthy learning environments benefit from diverse perspectives. A total of 21 undergraduate students actively worked on the project. Notably, the PIs mentored two graduate research assistants from underrepresented groups who were former undergraduate assistants, both honored with the Outstanding Graduate Research Award in 2021 and 2022 at KSU.</p> <p>The products produced from the project include CAD models, parts lists, learning activities, and virtual labs shared through the project GitHub Repository. In addition to the repository, the project has made significant scholarly contributions with seven conference papers and four journal publications. Moreover, the dissemination efforts extended beyond publications. Undergraduate students showcased the lab equipment at the American Control Conference in 2022 and presented research findings at ASME IMECE Conferences each year that the project was active, expanding the project's reach within the academic and engineering communities.</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 01/19/2024<br> Modified by: Ayse&nbsp;Tekes</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687978219_Design_and_Cad_Model--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687978219_Design_and_Cad_Model--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Control Lab Equipment"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687978219_Design_and_Cad_Model--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Control Lab Equipment"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The image shows the controlled equipment to demonstrate the effect of disturbances.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ayse Tekes</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ayse&nbsp;Tekes <div class="imageTitle">Control Lab Equipment</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687460601_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687460601_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SDOF Pendulum"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687460601_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SDOF Pendulum"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The images shows the SDOF pendulum system</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ayse Tekes</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ayse&nbsp;Tekes <div class="imageTitle">SDOF Pendulum</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687896376_Cantilever_Beam_experimental--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687896376_Cantilever_Beam_experimental--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cantilever Beam with Springs"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687896376_Cantilever_Beam_experimental--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cantilever Beam with Springs"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The image shows the experimental setup of the cantilever beam with compression springs.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ayse Tekes</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ayse&nbsp;Tekes <div class="imageTitle">Cantilever Beam with Springs</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687653356_Prototype2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687653356_Prototype2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Rotating Unbalance System"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687653356_Prototype2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Rotating Unbalance System"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The image shows the unbalanced rotating system to demonstrate undesired vibrations in a vibratory system.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ayse Tekes</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ayse&nbsp;Tekes <div class="imageTitle">Rotating Unbalance System</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687215150_20210402_160905--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687215150_20210402_160905--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Rectilinear System"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2002350/2002350_10679662_1705687215150_20210402_160905--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Rectilinear System"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The image shows the rectilinear (translational) lab equipment.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ayse Tekes</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ayse&nbsp;Tekes <div class="imageTitle">Rectilinear System</div> </div> </li></ul> </div> </div></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
