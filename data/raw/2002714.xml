<AbstractNarration>Bats are known for their aerial acrobatics skills that enable them to maneuver in dense vegetation, to catch preys, and find nutrients. Accomplishing these multitude of functions requires the bats to control, adapt, and coordinate their wing motions, body posture, and internal actions that they engage in while airborne. This project seeks to understand how bats master the integration of kinematics, aerodynamics, and control in such complex aerial behaviors.  This would shed light on underlying fluid dynamics and kinematic controls in biology, and also impact  the ability for engineers to replicate such abilities in technical systems in the next-generation multiple-functioning drones with flapping flight. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to understand aerial multi-tasking by bats based on comprehensive experiments and mathematical models. The project will obtain experimental data from two different approaches: The morphing wing kinematics of the bats during demanding flight maneuvers and behavioral multi-tasking situations will be recorded with an array of synchronized high-speed cameras and processed with deep learning methods. These biological data will be complemented by experiments with a biomimetic robotic system that will be implemented to mimic the bats' morphing wings and will be used to explore a larger parameter spaces than would be possible with observations of the animals. This will provide insights into the effects of different kinematic patterns. In parallel, mathematical models of flapping flight will be developed to extract the key physics in the sophisticated maneuvers seen the in the experiments. The simulation of flapping flight will further elucidate the trade-off between the energetics and stability of flight. Throughout the project, we will actively disseminate our findings to educate K-12 students and the general public. Since the bat experiments will be performed at the University of Brunei, the project will give participating undergraduate and graduate students unique exposure to the outstanding biodiversity of Borneo's rainforests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Bats, the only mammals with powered flight, provide inspiration to engineer highly maneuverable flapping wing aerial vehicles due to their ability in performing several complex maneuvers. While straight flight maneuvers have been extensively studied, drinking flight maneuvers have not. Additionally, drinking flights pose several major challenges, as an error in either drinking, flapping flight, or their coordination could lead to fatal accidents, such as tumbling into water. In this project, we investigated how bats are able to overcome the challenges of this complex behavior using experimental, theoretical and computational approaches.      Here, we presented three significant outcomes from this support.      First, we studied two insectivorous bat species in terms of wing kinematics and aerodynamics during drinking flight: Hipposideros pratti and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. During drinking, both bat species decrease their flapping amplitude while simultaneously increasing their flapping frequency. Furthermore, drinking flight maneuvers are observed to restrict the overall range of motion of the wing as compared to straight flight maneuvers. In addition, the angle of attack on the handwing at the end of downstroke is higher by almost 30o-40o in drinking flight indicating an active control to manipulate the aerodynamic forces as per the requirements of the maneuver. A quasi-steady aerodynamic model yields experimental lift coefficient of 2 for straight flight but 5 for drinking flight. The factor of 2.5 increase in the lift coefficient suggests a ground effect based lift enhancement mechanism during in-flight drinking and invites future studies to further explore the mechanism.      Second, we designed a bat mimicking robot with 3d printed parts which can perform a synchronized pitching motion along with flapping motion of the wings, similar to observations from our flight experiments above. This design allows to alter the mean pitch angle during a wingbeat and thus the mean angle of attack on the wing. The bat robot can also achieve flapping frequencies similar to ones observed in our flight experiments. We are working to test lift and drag forces on our robot in the wind-tunnel to understand the effect of different mean pitch angles.      Third, the project has developed a set of methods for recovering the 3d kinematics of bats in the form of high-resolution digital models that do not require artificial landmarks or any form of user intervention. The method is based on the combination of a digital anatomical model and an AI (deep-learning) algorithm that fits the model to high-speed video footage from the bats. It could have a transformative impact on the study of animal flight kinematics because it could provide 3d kinematic models form a large number of flight recordings that could then form the basis to an AI-based analysis of the variability in these complex animal behaviors.
