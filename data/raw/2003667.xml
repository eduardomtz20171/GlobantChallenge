<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Drs. Nicholas Taylor and Kristina Lemmer at Western Michigan University and Daniel Austin at Brigham Young University are working to develop a novel miniaturized instrument for field-portable chemical analysis based on a powerful method known as mass spectrometry. Specifically, the team seeks to develop a device capable of more detailed and yet faster analysis than is currently possible in field-portable analyzers.  The ability to provide industry and the scientific community with a simple, lightweight, and portable tool capable of rapid in situ chemical measurements can have a societal impact on many areas including biochemistry, pharmacology, environmental monitoring, threat detection, industrial monitoring and quality control, as well as planetary exploration. The work is being conducted by undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and aerospace engineering, including members of underrepresented groups.  This cross-disciplinary collaboration resonates with NSF’s goal to enhance convergence research while inspiring and helping train the next generation of scientists and engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Field portable systems equipped with highly miniaturized ion trap mass analyzers will possess the ability to rapidly and reliably make quantitative chemical measurements of a wide range of molecular species. The novel coaxial ion trap being designed and build by the Taylor team utilizes a rectilinear ion guide (RIG) for efficient injection of internally or externally generated ions into a high capacity simplified toroidal ion trap (STorIT) for ion accumulation and storage. Ions of analytical interest stored in the toroidal trapping region are mass selectively injected into a cylindrical ion trap (CIT) nested within the toroidal trapping ring.  The process of spatially isolating ions for MSn analysis can be repeated for a range of species without having to repopulate the toroidal trapping region, enhancing analytical efficiency. Since a single mass is injected into the CIT for MSn analysis, there is an inherent reduction in chemical noise which enhances the device’s detection limits and identification confidence. The system is being modeled and experimentally evaluated through a collaborative effort between Western Michigan University and Brigham Young University. Three target applications will allow testing of key performance features: rapid analysis of suspected illegal drug powders, sensitive detection of tracer compounds used in natural gas and petroleum wells, and characterization of semi-volatile compounds in atmospheric aerosols.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Taylor group at Western Michigan University and the Austin group at Brigham Young University collaborated on this effort to develop and demonstrate a coaxial ion trap mass analyzer with integrated rectilinear ion guide. This coaxial trap includes two separate, radiofrequency quadrupolar trapping regions, one toroidal region surrounding one cylindrical region. This design allows ions to be trapped and stored in the outer region, then transferred to the central region for analysis. This new device allows capabilities important for a portable mass spectrometric chemical analyzer: better chemical selectivity (important for complex, real-world samples), better sensitivity (due to the large trapping volume of the outer trapping regions), and the ability to run several separate types of analysis from a single sampling event. The integrated rectilinear ion guide enhances ion injection and allows a wide variety of ion sources to be used with the trap. The use of flat plate electrodes rather than electrodes of complex 3-dimensional shape facilitates miniaturization, ultimately leading to a smaller device than can be taken into the field.    Under this NSF grant we used computer simulations to understand and optimize the device design and operational parameters. The device was then built and successfully tested, showing better-than-unit mass resolution for ions of various gases and compounds.    This effort also accomplished several broader impacts. The developed technology will lead to improved in-field chemical analysis, important for emergency responders, national security, and point-of-care diagnostics. Several students were trained in instrument building, in conducting research, and in working in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary research team.
