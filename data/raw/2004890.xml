<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Summary&lt;br/&gt;Proteins that lack defined structures play many important roles in biology and in materials, mediating functions from the organization of molecules in the interior of cells to the production of elastomeric materials that can stretch multiple times their original length without permanent deformation. Despite the widespread utility of these types of proteins, detailed understanding of the molecular features that define their properties is still just emerging, which has limited their application in high-performance biomaterials. This proposal addresses this gap by developing computational and experimental methods that will describe how the composition of the proteins and the properties of their solutions can provide handles for making patterned elastomeric matrices, which in the long term will address critical societal challenges such as engineering living materials, controlling placement of biomolecules to conduct chemical functions, and/or more efficient energy storage. The research in this program will also impact educational activities for students of a variety of ages and experience. A series of student-initiated activities and podcasts, in which the PIs will participate, will help transfer concepts of this program into secondary school curricula and hands-on experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical summary&lt;br/&gt;Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of two dissimilar solutions is a fundamental thermodynamic process with significant importance in the development of advanced materials and for the assembly of membraneless organelles such as the nucleolus. The use of protein LLPS to purposefully design new materials could be significantly advanced if finer details were known about how select features of the polypeptide chain and its solutions drive the thermodynamics and kinetics of phase separation in the IDPs. The overarching goal of this proposal, accordingly, is to leverage unique capabilities of the investigators in computer modeling and recombinant design of resilin-like IDPs (RLPs) to design protein coacervates that display tunable material properties at the mesoscale. The project will leverage a closed-loop format, combining state-of-the-art simulations of protein LLPS alongside extensive experimental characterization of RLPs to provide iterative feedback about the role of amino acid composition, sequence, and co-solutes (salt or PEG) in LLPS. Variations in the experimentally determined second virial coefficients for selected RLPs, and their match (or deviation) from computation will enable fine-tuning of computational methods. Detailed spectroscopy and scattering characterization will enable correlation with computational prediction and further serve to establish the roles of coacervate concentration and composition in hydrogel morphology and properties. Taken together, these studies will deepen fundamental understanding of thermodynamics and kinetics of the LLPS of IDPs and will allow for unprecedented control over the design of condensates with controlled microstructure and composition as elements in biomaterials design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The work funded by this NSF award enabled study of the interactions of a class of proteins, called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), and guided the production of protein-based, microstructured materials. This understanding and resulting materials have broad impact in a variety of applications, ranging from treating disease, to targeted delivery of drugs, to the production of materials that can help heal and regenerate tissues such as those in the intestines.   Although IDPs lack any solution structure, the individual proteins can interact with one another by the interaction of their building blocks (amino acids). A general principle guiding the scientific community prior to our studies was that interactions of IDPs were mediated primarily by amino acids that are positively charged with those that have aromaticity.   By using a combination of computational simulation and experiment, our team was able to demonstrate that there are many more amino acids that participate in the interactions of the IDPs with one another, and that as a result of these interactions, form concentrated IDP-rich droplets in solution, during a process called liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS).   The computational results then guided the production of a set of model IDPs from bacteria. After purification of the model IDPs, experimental characterization of the mechanical properties of the IDP-rich droplets permitted correlation of the IDP composition (and thus specific interactions between select amino acids) with specific IDP-droplet mechanical properties.   This has allowed us to produce IDP-based materials that have controlled microstructures on the same size scale as cells in human tissue, so our approaches offer new ways to consider making cell-laden materials in microenvironments with controlled compositions and controlled mechanical properties. In the long term, we will use these materials as platforms to study tissue development and in biomedical applications.     Last Modified: 10/24/2024       Submitted by: KristiLKiick]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
