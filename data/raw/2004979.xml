<AbstractNarration>Nickel-based superalloys have a number of critical applications relevant to the US economy and national defense, including commercial and military jet engines, gas turbines, and power generators. These materials can operate at relatively high temperatures, but often are limited in their application by their poor performance at the highest operating temperatures. In order to design superalloys that can withstand ever increasing temperatures, it is necessary first to understand what happens at the microscopic level in these alloys. This award supports fundamental research to understand the microscopic processes that control superalloy behavior at high temperatures, and the development of robust computational tools to predict this behavior and design high-performance materials. The approach takes advantage of a unique high-throughput approach to experimental characterization, coupled with a data-driven computational approach to enable the calculation of phase stability in these superalloys. This project will educate next-generation materials scientists and engineers with strong materials processing expertise and both computational and experimental skills to better serve the U.S. manufacturing industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of this research is to establish a new paradigm for reliable and effective assessments of the thermodynamic stability of intermetallic phases during process. This objective will be achieved by: 1) performing high-throughput first-principles calculations of sublattice stabilities and atomic interaction energetics in individual sublattices of the complex topological close-packed (TCP) phases with multiple sublattices (Wyckoff sites) that cannot be directly measured experimentally; 2) exploring innovative and systematic strategies to enable facile incorporation of first-principles results into calculation of phase diagrams ; 3) making high-throughput diffusion multiples to obtain reliable phase diagrams of ternary systems critical to TCP phase stability evaluation, and employing the data to optimize the Gibbs energy parameters of the phases; and 4) expanding the infrastructure capabilities to seamlessly use both first-principles calculation results and experimental data to perform high-throughput phase diagram calculations, including uncertainty quantifications. In addition to establishing a new paradigm in phase diagram modeling, the outcomes of this study include valuable phase diagrams of important ternary systems obtained from diffusion multiples, and a set of reliable Gibbs energy functions for the TCP phases modeled from both experimental phase diagrams and density functional theory (DFT) predictions that can be incorporated into thermodynamic databases for Ni-based superalloys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Avoidance of the formation of the detrimental topologically-close-packed (TCP) phases is a key alloy design criterion for both Ni-based superalloys that are bread and butter of both the jet engine and gas turbine industry. The objective of this collaborative NSF project of University of Maryland and Penn State was to establish a new methodology for reliable and effective assessments of the thermodynamic stability of the TCP phases. This objective was achieved by: 1) performing high-throughput first-principles calculations of &ldquo;sublattice stabilities&rdquo; and atomic interaction energetics in individual sublattices of the complex TCP phases with multiple sublattices (Wyckoff sites); and 2) performing high-throughput diffusion-multiple measurements to obtain reliable phase diagrams of critical ternary systems as input to CALPHAD assessments.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The 700 &deg;C isothermal sections of the Co-Cr-Ta, Co-Cr-W, Co-Ni-Ta, and Co-Ni-W ternary systems were experimentally determined by performing wavelength-dispersive spectroscopy (WDS) mapping of a diffusion multiple. Our phase equilibrium data are especially valuable since intermediate temperature data (&lt; 900 &deg;C) are hard to obtain due to sluggish diffusion coefficients. Our data were obtained from a diffusion multiple that was annealed at 700 &deg;C for 3000 hours; and they will be very valuable input to future thermodynamic reassessments to improve the prediction of phase stability of the TCP phases. For instance, the Fe-Nb and Fe-Nb-Ni systems were remodeled using updated sublattice models with new experimental data from a diffusion multiple and DFT calculations. The new thermodynamic description of the Fe-Nb-Ni system includes a new hexagonal phase hP24 and agrees better with the experimental phase equilibrium data from the diffusion multiple and the literature. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2024.119747">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2024.119747</a></p> <p>An integrated ML and CALPHAD analysis was performed on the phase formation in 2436 experimentally measured&nbsp;<a title="Learn more about high entropy alloy from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/high-entropy-alloys">high entropy alloy</a>s&nbsp;(HEAs) consisting of various quinary mixtures of Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Ni.

Four ML algorithms were employed to study the phase selection rules for two different datasets, one consisting of 1761 solid-solution (SS) HEAs without AM and/or IM phases, and the other set consisting of all the 2436 HEA compositions. VEC was found to be most important parameter in phase prediction for BCC/B2, BCC/B2&nbsp;+&nbsp;FCC, and FCC phases. Electronegativity difference and FCC-BCC-index (FBI) are the two dominating features in determining the formation of SS, AM, SS +&nbsp;AM, and IM.
