<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation by graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other early-career researchers in the 34th Annual Workshop on Automorphic Forms and Related Topics (AFW), held May 11-15, 2020 at the Moab Arts and Recreation Center in Moab, UT. The AFW began in the 1980s and has grown to become an internationally-recognized conference in number theory. Typically, about half of the attendees at the AFW are at early stages of their careers, and organizers make a particular effort to support women at all career stages. The AFW will continue to provide an exceptionally supportive, welcoming, and inclusive environment for giving talks and for collaboration among participants. In addition to the research talks, the AFW will continue the longstanding tradition of having two professional development panels on mathematical career questions. To increase accessibility to a wider audience, the 2020 AFW will feature daily expository talks on various fundamental topics in the theory of automorphic forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automorphic forms play a central role in number theory, being integral to the proofs of many groundbreaking theorems, including Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem and the Sato-Tate Conjecture. They are the subject of many important ongoing conjectures, among them the Langlands program, connections to random matrix theory, and the generalized Riemann hypothesis. They also appear in many areas of mathematics outside number theory, most notably in mathematical physics. The topics covered in this year's workshop are likely to include Maass wave forms, mock modular forms, quadratic forms and theta functions, elliptic curves, special values of L-functions, Siegel, Jacobi, and Hilbert modular forms, Langlands functoriality, p-adic modular forms and p-adic L-functions, arithmetic statistics, Galois representations, and Kloosterman sums. The workshop website is http://automorphicformsworkshop.org/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
