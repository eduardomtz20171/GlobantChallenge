<AbstractNarration>Many systems of interest in science, technology, and medicine can be represented as networks, including the Internet, the power grid, neural networks in the brain, and the contact networks between individuals over which diseases spread. This project focuses on modeling of such networked systems using mathematical and computer models and will address two areas of need. The first concerns how we determine the structure of networks in the first place. To make a model of, for instance, a disease outbreak, one must determine the pattern of contacts between people in order to understand spread. Experimental measurements of network structure, however, are known to have inaccuracies and can give misleading results. To circumvent the impossible task of making perfect measurements, this project will use a combination of state-of-the-art computational and mathematical techniques to formulate methods for making accurate estimates of network structure even when the underlying data are unreliable. The result will be new ways to make more trustworthy calculations of network quantities and precise indications of the margin of error that can be used to inform scientific judgment. The second focus of this project is the development of new computer algorithms for calculation of network quantities using the mathematical technique known as belief propagation. These algorithms will focus on calculations such as resilience of networks to failure or attack, outcomes of epidemiological processes, or large-scale structural features of networks. As an example, belief propagation methods permit calculation of the expected number of individuals who will be infected by a disease given the structure of a contact network and fundamental parameters of the disease itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop new mathematical methods for the analysis of network data, for the self-consistent solution of processes taking place on networks, and for optimal estimation of network properties in the presence of measurement error. The first of two research themes will focus on message passing methods, a powerful class of self-consistent methods for solving for the structural and dynamical properties of networked systems. Though useful, these methods have long been handicapped by technical limitations that restrict their use to loop-free, or nearly loop-free, networks. Building on successful preliminary studies, this project will show how these limitations can be overcome and develop a new generation of message passing methods that work on realistic networks, including those with a high density of loops. A range of specific applications will be pursued and the methods developed will also serve as the foundation for new formal developments, such as new random graph models, theories of structural phase transitions in networks, and the computation of spectra for very large networks. A second theme will focus on rigorous methods for making estimates of network structure from rich but potentially unreliable data sources. Most empirical observations of network structure contain measurement error of one kind or another, but these errors are rarely considered, in part for lack of a comprehensive mathematical framework for treating them. This project will develop such a framework, based on formal models of the measurement process coupled with statistical and machine learning tools including Bayesian methods, expectation-maximization algorithms, and Monte Carlo techniques. The result will be a new set of tools that allow practitioners to make reliable estimates of networks and their properties from noisy data and to quantify the level of uncertainty in those estimates. In collaboration with domain experts in computer science, biology, and the social sciences, specific applications of these methods will be developed for systems such as the Internet, ecological networks, and social networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Intellectual merit: Recent years have seen an influx of new data and insights about networks like the Internet, transportation networks, the web, biochemical networks, ecological networks, and social networks both on- and off-line. By studying the structure of these networks we can answer questions such as "How can we make a transportation network more efficient?" or "How does a disease spread over the network of contacts between individuals?" The work conducted under this award has focused on the development of new mathematical methods for analyzing and understanding networks such as these. The methods fall under two main topic headings. The first topic is about so-called message passing methods, a class of methods for calculating properties and processes on networks using iterated equations. Developed since the 1980s, these methods have been widely applied to many important network problems, including the spread of disease, network resilience, network modularity, and probabilistic processes. However, message passing methods have a weakness in that they cannot be applied to networks that contain a lot of closed loops, which prevents their application in many real-world situations. The work performed under this funding has found a new solution to this long-standing problem, showing how one can derive message-passing equations on networks with loops using a new construction for interacting network neighborhoods. These developments have allowed us to apply message passing methods in contexts where previously they were inapplicable.  The second main topic of study has been network reconstruction, the process of determining the structure of a network even when the data available are of poor quality and contain errors, as is commonly the case. For instance, in constructing a network of acquaintanceship within a group of people one typically relies on self-reports by members of the group, received from interviews or questionnaires. Such self-reports are, however, unreliable and subjective, and hence so are the derived data. As this work has shown, it is possible to determine the structure of a network reliably even when the data are unreliable by employing statistical models of network structure and fitting them to observed measurements. This work has developed a number of such models, fitting methods based on maximum-likelihood and Bayesian inference, and a range of different applications, to social network data, ecological networks, and the Internet, among others.  In addition to these primary topics of study, a number of related areas have also been addressed as part of this award, particularly focusing on ranking problems (methods and algorithms for identifying the most important or central nodes in a network) and information theory (methods for quantifying complexity and similarity of properties of networks).  Broader impacts: The broader impacts of the work and benefits to society at large have taken a number of forms. Several graduate students have participated in the research as a part of their PhD training at the University of Michigan. Computer algorithms and software developed for the analysis of network data have been made publicly available. The funded research has involved interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers in a range of other fields, such as computer science and ecology, to develop applications outside of the immediate field of applied mathematics. Members of the group have participated in interdisciplinary conferences and workshops aimed disseminating the results and encouraging new applications. Wider benefits to society include the potential to improve our understanding of the resilience of networked systems and the role of contact networks in epidemiology and public health, as well as more general improved understanding of technological, social, and biological networks.
