<AbstractNarration>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that over 41 million people connect to nature through birding. Learning about birds in their natural environments offers opportunities for informal engagement in STEM by a broad range of individuals and groups. Birders often engage in scientific data gathering and analyses, geolocation and remote sensing, and phenology. They also become aware of ecological changes in bird habitats and migratory patterns due to rising temperatures and climate-related events like sea level rise, droughts, fires, and extreme weather. As such, the birding community is an ideal network to better understand and communicate the impacts of climatological changes on bird populations to the public. With this Innovations in Development project, the National Audubon Society will develop a new avian-focused, conservation and climate science community science curriculum for its Nature Centers, and test the effectiveness of the curriculum in educating the public about avian-focused conservation and climatological changes through guided nature experiences. Birding can serve as a pivotal entrée for young people into STEM fields and careers. Through its programs and partnerships, Audubon will leverage its national network to ensure that through this project a more diverse group of voices – particularly young adults and young adults of color – become involved in asking critical questions and developing solutions to address important environmental issues of the future. If successful, the broader impacts of this project on capacity building and public engagement could be far-reaching and long-lasting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the three-year project duration, Audubon will bring educators from its nationwide network of thirty-four Nature Centers (including urban, suburban, and rural sites), together with over 510 young adults (ages 18-25) from its network of college campus chapters.  An evidence-based curriculum and community science activities will be created and tested, relying heavily on a team of experts in ornithology, climate science research, STEM curriculum design, diversity, and informal science education. College students will advise on the design of content and activities to effectively interest and engage young adults. These students will be recruited from the new Audubon Campus Chapters Program, which includes 111 college and university campuses – among them, 19 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). The target population will be surveyed to also understand their current and likely participation in guided nature experiences and knowledge base in climate science. Current best practices in guided nature experiences will be gathered from across the Audubon network. The implementation efforts will result in a national STEM model, with train-the-trainer guides and workshops for informal science educators and public engagement opportunities focused on improving the state and condition of avian habitats and communities through climate science research. An external evaluation will be conducted and will include data collection methods such as retrospective pre and post surveys, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and an embedded assessment to determine impact. The findings will be used to iteratively refine the evidence-based curriculum and measure STEM learning outcomes for the guided nature experience participants. The evaluation will address four areas: (1) fidelity of program implementation to promote accountability; (2) formative evaluation to understand needs and interests of young adults (ages 18-25), and subsequently inform program design; (3) outcomes for Center educators, to inform iterative improvement; and (4) outcomes for program participants, to contribute to the growing knowledge base on effective practices for STEM learning in informal settings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Innovations in Development project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    National Audubon Society program staff collaborated with 18- to 25-year-olds, including students from Audubons campus chapters, to create a novel curriculum that uses birds and guided nature experiences to engage this age group in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math) and climate science. The curriculum was informed by input from over 600 18- to 25-year-olds who filled out surveys, participated in focus groups, co-created, and tested activities.        The curriculum recognizes that participants aspire to be guided (not talked at) in these experiences, that ideal activities in nature are small, social and inclusive, and that they are interested in activities that connect to issues such as climate change and provide opportunities for action.        The curriculum elevates the use of apps and digital tools  both as a point of entry for STEM discussions and as a low-barrier point of entry to nature for digital natives. Its interactive activities were road-tested and refined by staff and students at 12 Audubon Conservation Action Centers. The activities feature explicit discussion of actions participants can take to help counter the climate challenges that birds, with their plummeting populations, face. The result is a new curriculum explicitly designed and demonstrated to inspire and empower young adults to increase their participation in field science and conservation programs, so that they become not just a visitor to nature, but also connected to and invested in its health.         This project demonstrates that informal STEM learning in parks, nature centers, and urban habitats can significantly increase STEM participation and identity among 18- to 25-year-olds. Co-creation and explicit inclusion practices help broaden engagement with traditionally underrepresented audiences. Guided engagement with the natural world offers a significant opportunity to connect 18- to 25-year-olds with STEM disciplines.
