<AbstractNarration>A research collaboration between Harvard University, George Mason University, the University of California-Riverside, and the University of Montana will use a telescope network to observe planet candidates orbiting nearby stars. The planet candidates have been identified by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Planets will be confirmed, their masses and orbits will be measured. The work will help create improved theories of the formation and evolution of planets with a broad range of environments. Some of the planets confirmed will be the ones that provide the best chance of detecting life in the future. The award will fund students to participate in Harvard's Banneker Institute. This undergraduate summer program focuses on recruiting under-represented minorities for a program of research, graduate school preparation, and social justice education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigation will employ two dedicated robotic arrays of four 0.7-meter telescopes (MINERVA-North and MINERVA-Australis) in both hemispheres for all sky access to confirm and characterize TESS planet candidates. The facilities will perform a large scale survey to measure the orbital obliquities of approximately 180 planets, enabling a more robust understanding of formation and migration of planets as a function of the properties of the host star and their planets. MINERVA will also measure planet masses and orbital eccentricities, and search for additional planets in each system. The confirmation and characterization of new planetary systems around the bright TESS host stars will identify the best possible targets for future detailed follow up. The planets confirmed and characterized will be the ones the next generation of space-borne exoplanet missions and ground-based extremely large telescopes will prioritize to measure the detailed atmospheric compositions and will provide the best chances of detecting biomarkers. The survey will allow a more detailed understanding of planet formation and migration as a function of stellar and planetary properties. The nature of exoplanet observations generates opportunities for projects ideal for student involvement at all levels. In addition, MINERVA's dedicated array of small telescopes provides a unique platform to develop valuable instrumentation experience. MINERVA provides a scientific backbone for undergraduate research opportunities, undergraduate theses, post-baccalaureate research experience, and graduate research experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

These discoveries are still relatively recent, with the<br />vast majority occurring over the past few decades.

While the Solar System remains our best studied example<br />of a planetary system, observations of exoplanets have expanded our<br />horizons to reveal planets and planetary system architectures that are<br />substantially different from our home system. Some of these new<br />planetary types include hot Jupiters, sub-Neptunes, and volatile-rich<br />terrestrial planets. These include systems, some orbiting G dwarfs<br />like our Sun, where multiple planets are found within the equivalent<br />of the orbit of Mercury.<br /><br />Fundamental planetary properties include the mass of the planet and<br />the shape of the orbit. These properties may be extracted by measuring<br />the radiel velocity (RV) of the star, influenced by the gravitational<br />effects of the orbiting planet. A major activity of this project<br />involved the assessment of exoplanet targets from the Transiting<br />Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and their suitability for RV<br />follow-up observations. Current RV programs for ephemeris refinement<br />rely on semi-consistent monitoring of targets. However, facilities<br />that can produce such observations are limited, necessitating<br />optimization of observations. Graduate student, Zhexing Li, has<br />conducted thousands of simulations that test the orbital period<br />uncertainty reduction against three variables: number, epoch, and<br />orbital phase coverage of synthetic future observations. The attached<br />figure shows one of the simulation results that varies the number of<br />future observations for the known exoplanet host, HD 134987. The<br />orbital period uncertainty shows an initial drastic decline, whereby<br />additional data points do not significantly improve the orbital<br />ephemeris. The results of this work has produced a relationship<br />describing the ephemeris improvement with respect to these three<br />variables, allowing this project to extend orbital refinement work to<br />all targets and plan the most efficient precursor<br />observations. Furthermore, Zhexing has made numerous improvements to<br />the radial velocity code, particularly modoficiations that better<br />account for highly eccentric orbits and large mass ratios of companion<br />to host star.
