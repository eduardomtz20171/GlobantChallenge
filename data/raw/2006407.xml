<AbstractNarration>The ever-increasing demand for optimized large-scale computing systems puts pressure on attaining significant improvements in automated design optimization and synthesis tools. This project aims to overcome the limitations of prior approaches through a tighter integration of optimization and synthesis algorithms leveraging advances in modern automated reasoning systems.  The project demonstrates the power of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)-based synthesis combined with emerging research in Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project explores advances in both theory and practice, with research demonstrations integrated into CVC4, the only SMT solver today providing synthesis features.  In particular, CVC4 is being extended with optimization capabilities, making it the first automated reasoning tool capable of performing synthesis and optimization together. The resulting extensible framework enables system design for emerging technologies which often require reasoning over non Boolean (and mixed) primitives. The extensibility and generality of the approach charts a new direction of research at the intersection of synthesis and optimization, leads towards more scalable and complex system design, and allows optimization over a broader class of objectives including security and safety.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The approach taken set out a novel methodology of combining Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)-based synthesis with cutting-edge research in optimization modulo theories. The framework was showcased on synthesis problems for emerging computing technologies, in particular on race logic for superconducting circuit design. The project pursued two primary objectives:   (i) Theoretical Endeavor: develop a theoretical framework for combining synthesis and optimization;   (ii) Implementation Endeavour: implement the synthesis and optimization framework inside a state-of-the-art SMT solver cvc5;   Within the purview of these objectives, the following milestones were accomplished.   (i) We developed the first abstract calculus for Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT). The introduction of the calculus is poised to have a groundbreaking impact on the field of OMT. Much like the abstract DPLL(T) calculus for Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), the objective of this calculus is twofold: to establish a theoretical foundation for understanding and research, and to serve as a blueprint for practical implementations.   We proposed a new standard for the OMT input format, aiming to establish a unified and standardized OMT language within the OMT community.   (ii) We prototyped both the integration of the OMT calculus into the cvc5 SMT solver and the augmentation of cvc5s synthesis engine with weighted synthesis capabilities. Both extensions are poised to be included in an official cvc5 release. The impact of this accomplishment is twofold.
