<AbstractNarration>Crowdsourcing is an approach to solving problems via distributed effort.  In the future, crowdsourcing mechanisms should prove useful in gathering and aggregating information in a variety of contexts including basic scientific research, reputation systems, peer grading, and many decision-making contexts including purchasing, product development, pricing, etc.  This project will design practical crowdsourcing mechanisms to incentivize users to report accurate data, even when the veracity cannot be directly verified.   A key part of this is accurately measuring the quality of the information reported.  Building mechanisms sufficiently robust for dealing with diverse types of agents is necessary for the success of this proposal.  Thus, it has applications beyond crowdsourcing to big data more broadly (interpreting data from diverse sources of varying reliability) and algorithmic fairness.  The research efforts will be integrated with the educational and outreach activities of the investigator, who has a record of broadly disseminating cutting-edge research to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students through teaching, outreach programs, and personal mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent developments in the field of information elicitation show how to use information-theoretic concepts to truthfully elicit unverifiable information from agents.  The heart of these results is first to employ clever techniques to indirectly measure ``mutual information" between agents, then to compensate agents proportionally to the mutual information measurement.  There is also increasing work in learning theory, especially to enable learning with noisy or adversarial data.   The goal of this proposal is to create a bridge between the information-elicitation and information-aggregation tasks.  By using an information-theoretic underpinning we can unify the progress of these fields, and, in many instances, fuse these tasks together. The project will undertake the following. 1) Design full pipeline systems by uniting the techniques of information elicitation and aggregation into one streamlined process.  2)  Examine how to better measure information-theoretic concepts required for truthful elicitation algorithms.   3) Address important concerns such as algorithmic fairness, optimal and realistic payments, and robustness.   Moreover, this proposal will help to better integrate information theory into the computer-science community, which is essential in the era of data science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project focused on developing and analyzing systems that enable high-quality decisions by combining tools from machine learning, economics (e.g game theory, mechanism design, and information design), and computer science more generally. This is accomplished by eliciting and aggregating information from diverse agents with varying information, interests, abilities, and objectives.   A key bottleneck is such systems is often eliciting high quality information. To this end, this project designed mechanisms that reward (either explicitly or implicitly) agents for high-quality reports. The challenge is that, if the system does not know the correct answer, how might they reward the agent so that it is in the agents best interest to provide high-quality accurate reports?   This project shows how to augment previous mechanisms using machine learning. In particular, this project developed the Pairing Mechanism, which uses a variational technique to reduce the mechanism design problem to a learning problem, where known machine learning techniques can be applied.   This integration of information elicitation and sophisticated machine learning tools leads to much more realistic mechanisms, along several dimensions. First, the payments of the new mechanisms contain much less noise, an important consideration. Second, this project shows how these more accurate payments can be leveraged into better incentive properties for the effort of agents. Third, we can design mechanisms that work in a broader range of settings where, for example, agents are only required to answer a realistic number of questions (e.g. 4), different agents may answer different questions, and different agents may respond in systematically different ways.   The work of this project also applies to group decision making. Oftentimes a group is trying to make a decision (e.g. to hire a candidate) and the agents have both diverse information and diverse preferences. Moreover, an agents' preferences depend on some underlying state of the world (e.g. they prefer hiring both better candidates and candidates closer to their areas, but do not know the exact quality of each candidate). The challenge is that agents may be reluctant to reveal their information if they believe it will work against their preferences. This project extends information elicitation techniques to additionally work in strategic social choice settings where there are no payments, and the agents' preferences depend on a state of the world about which they only have partial knowledge. In these settings, the project has produced voting mechanisms where agents are incentivized to report truthfully and are guaranteed to effectively aggregate information.   The broader impacts of this research extend to scenarios where a collective decision-making process is required, such as peer grading, peer review, crowd-sourcing (e.g. rating the quality of large language model responses), content moderation, misinformation detection, surveys, and employment hiring/evaluation. We anticipate that the mechanisms designed by this project can be implemented soon in these contexts in order to improve the quality of information used in the decision making. Additionally, the research of this project has been integrated into classroom instruction to educate a range of students about information elicitation and aggregation.
