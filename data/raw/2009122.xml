<AbstractNarration>It is now known that supermassive black holes live at the centers of all galaxies. Over the past decade scientists have found that the masses of these monster black holes depend strongly on the properties of their host galaxies. Supermassive black holes, some of the most intriguing objects in the universe, also play a transformative role in how their parent galaxies evolve. While they are gigantic (between a million and a ten billion times the mass of the sun), supermassive black holes are only a fraction of a percent of the total mass of the galaxy they live in. Much is still not understood about how these black holes grew or how they were able to so dramatically influence galaxy evolution. To understand how black holes grow, it is first necessary to measure their masses, both in nearby galaxies and in distant galaxies. The ‘gold standard’ method for measuring black hole masses in nearby galaxies uses the motions of stars that orbit close to the black hole. In the nearby Universe most of the black holes that are still growing today (the so-called Active Galactic Nuclei) live in disk galaxies like our own Milky Way. The black holes in disk galaxies are less massive, and therefore are harder to study since they have weaker effects on the motion of stars around them.  The team will develop training tools to allow other scientists to use their new modeling software. Several undergraduate research students will participate in this research adding to their scientific and technical training and better equipping them for future pursuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The accurate determination of supermassive black hole masses in galaxies, both at low and high redshifts, underpins almost all efforts to understand galaxy evolution. Black hole mass measurements that use the dynamics of stars in galactic nuclei are the current ‘gold standard’. Black hole masses are found to be tightly correlated with the properties of their host galaxies over a very wide range of black hole masses (from 100 million to 10 billion times the mass of the sun). At lower black holes masses, found in predominantly disk-like galaxies, the correlations are weaker.  Spiral galaxies like our Milky Way, that contain a stellar bar (a rapidly rotating cigar-like central feature) show the most scatter. The team recently found that black hole mass measurements in barred galaxies can be overestimated when the bar is ignored, especially as the galaxy is viewed more face-on.  Since 65% of disk galaxies have stellar bars, this bias primarily affects black hole masses in galaxies at the low-end of the mass function. It also impacts the black hole mass scaling relations - the correlations between the host galaxy properties and black hole masses.  The new black hole mass measurements resulting from this project will better constrain the statistical uncertainties on the black hole masses at the low end of the black hole mass range, where it is most uncertain. They will also aid in determining the “reverberation mapping” mass scale a relationship that is crucial for future measurements of black hole masses at high redshift. The modeling will yield detailed three-dimensional distributions of the orbits of stars in the host galactic nuclei. The open source software that will be developed during this project will have broad applicability beyond black hole mass determination.  The team will also make available tutorials for using the software for modeling galaxies and involve several undergraduates in the research allowing them to apply state-of- the-art galactic dynamics modeling tools to real data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

These black holes (BHs) grow by consuming gas clouds and stars that eventually spiral close enough to fall into the BH&rsquo;s gravitational grip, falling into the BH and causing it to grow. However, for this to happen, the gas and stars must lose something called angular momentum&mdash;the property that keeps their orbits stable and nearly circular. The NSF funded project,&nbsp;<em>Raising the Bar for Black Hole Mass Measurements in Low-Mass Galaxies</em>, delves into how galactic features like "bars" influence the growth of SMBHs and sheds light on several mysteries of galactic evolution.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Galactic Bars: Catalysts for Black Hole Growth</strong></p>  <p>Galactic bars are elongated, cigar-shaped structures found in about two-thirds of disk galaxies. They rotate like propellers and act as channels for redistributing angular momentum, which facilitates the movement of stars and gas toward the galactic center. This makes bars crucial players in feeding SMBHs. Earlier computer simulations (1990s&ndash;2000s) suggested that when a black hole grows after the formation of a bar, it weakens the bar's structure. However, observational studies since the 2000s revealed that most SMBHs existed before bars formed, challenging these earlier findings. To address this discrepancy, researchers simulated scenarios where SMBHs either co-evolved with or predated bar formation. <strong><em>Surprisingly, they found that pre-existing SMBHs strengthened bars instead of weakening them!</em></strong></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>One key factor is a phenomenon called "bar buckling," where bars temporarily bend out of a galaxy's plane, weakening their structure. Bars with pre-existing SMBHs experienced less buckling, leading to stronger bars overall. The SMBHs disrupted the trajectories of nearby stars, giving them higher random velocities, which stabilized the bars. These findings, published by Wheeler et al. in&nbsp;<em>The Astrophysical Journal</em>&nbsp;in 2023, highlight how SMBHs and bars can mutually enhance each other&rsquo;s development.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Mapping Galactic Features in Three Dimensions</strong></p>  <p>Another major focus of this project was understanding boxy/peanut-shaped bulges (BP/X bulges), which are common in barred galaxies. These bulges are complex, three-dimensional structures that appear as distinct X-shapes or bow-ties when viewed edge-on. To measure the mass of SMBHs and study bar dynamics, scientists must first accurately reconstruct the 3D shapes of these bulges from their 2D images&mdash;a notoriously challenging task.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>The team also developed a new algorithm to address this challenge. Instead of directly trying to "deproject" 2D images into 3D shapes (an approach prone to errors), the team used a method called "forward modeling." This involves simulating a number of 3D shapes with different values of the parameters, projecting each into 2D, and tweaking the parameters until the simulated projection matches the observed image. This approach ensured physically realistic results, such as avoiding unphysical negative masses.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>By combining this method with existing modeling software called FORSTAND, the team achieved exceptional accuracy, recovering mass distributions with an error of less than 2% and recovered the unseen bar orientations within 15%. These tools now offer a groundbreaking way to measure the properties of barred galaxies with BP/X bulges, even when viewed edge-on.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Measuring Black Hole Masses in Real Galaxies</strong></p>  <p>The ultimate goal of this research was to apply these methods to real galaxies, enabling precise measurements of SMBH masses. One such galaxy, NGC 4151, was studied using data from the Gemini North telescope and archival observations from another instrument. The team measured the SMBH's mass to be between 2.5 million and 30 million times that of the Sun, a range that aligns with previous estimates based on gas dynamics and reverberation mapping. Another galaxy, NGC 5273, also revealed exciting results. Using FORSTAND, the researchers made the first stellar-dynamical measurement of its SMBH mass, estimating it to be about ten million solar masses. This finding closely matched independent measurements, showcasing the reliability of the new methods. These insights are especially valuable for galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN), where multiple techniques for measuring SMBH mass can be compared.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Paving the Way for Future Research</strong></p>  <p>This study not only advances our understanding of how SMBHs and galactic structures co-evolve but also provides cutting-edge tools for studying galaxies in unprecedented detail. By modeling the interactions between SMBHs, bars, and BP/X bulges, the project offers new ways to explore the mechanisms shaping galaxies across the cosmos.</p>  <p>The team is now applying these techniques to additional galaxies, including NGC 6814 and MCG-06-30-15, further refining our understanding of SMBH growth and bar dynamics.
