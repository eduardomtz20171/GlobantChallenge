<AbstractNarration>A research group of faculty and students from Johns Hopkins University will measure the ages of planets orbiting nearby stars. Many questions related to planet formation and evolution cannot be answered without a better understanding of planet ages. It is understood that both stars and their planets have the same age, however most of the usual ways to infer stellar ages fail for stars that host planets, so new approaches must be taken. The awarded investigation will apply a new method to derive ages for populations of stars. This new technique will then be used to identify why some planetary systems are different from our own. This research program will provide internships for STEM undergraduates from Morgan State University as well as Johns Hopkins University, and it will form the basis for a PhD thesis. In addition, this group will start a program of portable planetarium visits to several Baltimore City Enoch Pratt Public Library branches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The difficulty of estimating exoplanet host star ages is a major problem preventing progress in understanding planet formation and evolution. Traditional isochrone, asteroseismic, gyrochronological, stellar activity-based, or lithium-based age estimates are unreliable or unavailable for most planet host stars, so new approaches must be taken to solve the problem of exoplanet host star ages. As a thin disk stellar population ages, its constituent stars experience random kicks due to interactions with molecular clouds, transient disk features, and the Galactic bar. The investigation will make use of the Galactic velocity dispersion of a thin disk stellar population as a proxy for exoplanet age. The investigation will use this Galactic velocity dispersion technique to calculate relative ages for exoplanet host stars with different characteristic, as well as stars without planets, to explore planet formation and evolution. The application of the Galactic velocity dispersion technique for exoplanets could reveal the origin of significant stellar obliquities in exoplanet systems, the origin and fate of ultra-short orbital period planets, and the reason that multiple-planet systems are often observed just wide of mean-motion resonances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Like the Sun and its eight-planet solar system, some "exoplanet host-stars" are stars in our own Milky Way Galaxy that are orbited by their own planetary systems. For most of their existences, stars fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores during the main sequence phase of their stellar evolution and change only imperceptibly for billions of years. Determining the age of an isolated star on its main sequence is therefore one of the most challenging problems in astrophysics. Most known exoplanets orbit main sequence stars, so the ages of the exoplanet systems orbiting those main sequence stars are also hard to discern. For that reason, it has been impossible to study the time evolution of exoplanet systems.  This award supported the principal investigator (PI), two Johns Hopkins University (JHU) PhD students, and many JHU undergraduate students as they used the degree of randomness of the motions of exoplanet host-stars to study the otherwise unobservable time evolution of exoplanet systems due to tidal and gravitational interactions. This approach is attractive because, in the Milky Way, the dispersion in the velocities of individual stars in a stellar population is correlated with that population's age: a small spread implies a young age while a large spread implies an old age. Spreads in the velocities of stars hosting different subtypes of exoplanets can consequently be used to study the formation and evolution of those exoplanet subtypes.  In a planetary system, the angle between the angular momentum vectors defining the host star's rotation and the system's orbit---the host star's "obliquity"---often provides insight into the formation of the system inaccessible with any other observable quantity. Relative to its orbit with Jupiter that holds most of the solar system's angular momentum, the obliquity of the Sun is only about seven degrees. This low obliquity supports the idea that Jupiter---and the rest of the solar system's planets that share its orbital orientation---formed in a disk orbiting the young Sun.  The Sun's small obliquity it not shared by all planet-hosting stars, especially those stars that host a "hot Jupiter" planet with a mass comparable to Jupiter but a star--planet orbital separation less than 1/10 the average distance between the Earth and the Sun. The PI and his junior colleagues found that the population of these hot Jupiters with large host star obliquities is older than the population of hot Jupiters with small host star obliquities. This observational result was the opposite of what had been predicted by the most widely accepted explanation for the origin of large host star obliquities in hot Jupiter systems and implies that the mechanism responsible for large host star obliquities in hot Jupiter systems takes place long after those planetary systems first formed.  Before the discoveries of NASA's Kepler Space Telescope, it was thought that systems of low-mass planets would be found with a particular regularity. Moving away from the host star, the orbital period of each successive planet was expected to be the period of the previous planet multiplied by a factor very close to a ratio of small integers (e.g., 2/1, 3/2, etc.). This turned out not to be the case. While many planetary systems roughly followed the expectation, most of those systems had larger-than-expected period ratios and numerous models were proposed to reconcile the expectation with the observation. The PI and his junior colleagues showed that the subset of Kepler-discovered systems of low-mass planets that were found in configurations consistent with the pre-Kepler expectation are younger than the rest of the Kepler-discovered systems of low-mass planets.

This award also supported summer research fellowships for non-JHU students from backgrounds underrepresented in the United States' scientific workforce as well as both public-focused science outreach events at Baltimore City Enoch Pratt Public Library branches and Astronomy on Tap programming in Baltimore.
