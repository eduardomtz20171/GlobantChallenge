<AbstractNarration>Many studies over the past decade have demonstrated that cells respond to the stiffness of the surrounding tissue by pulling on it and sensing the stiffness, a process known as mechanotransduction. Cells use these mechanotransduction signals to make a host of decisions regarding survival, migration, and differentiation into different cell types. Increased tissue stiffness often accompanies various diseases including fibrotic diseases and cancer.  Previous studies suggest that these diseases may be driven by altered stiffness. However, there is another mechanical aspect of tissues that has not been studied to the same degree.  Tissues in the human body are “viscoelastic”, meaning that they behave like both a thick liquid and a stretchable spring. While many studies have investigated how changing the stiffness of the “spring” component affects cells, there have been far fewer studies of the effects of the viscous “thickness” component of the tissue. In this research, the use of novel polymers to separately change the viscosity and the stiffness of the surface under cells and determine the cellular responses to each component will be explored. This work will improve our understanding of how cells respond to their surroundings, which could lead to significant advances in our understanding of human health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies  from  the  past  two  decades  have  convincingly convincingly  that  cells  are  able  to  sense the  mechanical  properties  of  their  surroundings  and  make  major  decisions  in  response  to  this mechanosensation, including decisions regarding cell migration, proliferation, survival, and differentiation.   The  vast  majority  of  these  studies  have  focused  on  the  cellular  mechanoresponse  to changing substrate stiffness (or elastic modulus) and have been conducted on purely elastic substrates.   In  contrast, most  soft  tissues  in  the  human  body  exhibit  viscoelastic  behavior;  that  is, they generate responsive force proportional to both the magnitude and rate of strain.  What role does the viscous component of viscoelastic tissue play in driving the cellular mechanoresponse?  To answer this question, pairs of polymer substrates that have similar storage moduli (elastic component) but significantly different loss moduli (viscous component) are investigated.  The storage moduli for these pairs spans the range of healthy to diseased soft tissue.  The hypothesis is  that  increasing  loss  modulus  produces  similar  effects  to  increasing storage modulus; in other words, cells on an increasingly viscous substrate respond as if they are on a stiffer substrate.  Cell morphology,  traction force generation,  proliferation, migration, and differentiation to isolate the effects of viscous and elastic components of the substrate on cellular responses will be quantified.  Based on that step, an existing computational model of cell-substrate mechanical interactions will be modified to develop a potential mechanism to explain this response mechanistically.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

We have characterized how cells (specifically, fibroblasts) respond to changes in viscoelastic properties of the surface, including changes in how they migrate, proliferate, spread, and assemble extracellular matrix. These results indicate that fibroblasts on more viscous surfaces are able to spread to larger sizes and assemble more extracellular matrix, consistent with what typically happens on a stiffer surface.        We have developed a computational model that indicates a potential mechanism to explain why cells on more viscous surfaces behave similarly to cells on stiff surfaces; this model predicts that cells are able to generate longer, more sustained contractile forces on more viscous surfaces, allowing them to spread and assemble more extracellular matrix.         Together, this work has generated experimental and computational tools that allow for better understanding of how cells respond to viscoelastic surfaces, which are representative of tissue in the body. It has also provided insight into how cells respond to viscoelastic cues, which will potentially lead to better insights into the mechanobiological aspects of disease.
