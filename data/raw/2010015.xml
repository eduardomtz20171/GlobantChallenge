<AbstractNarration>Scientists are able to observe light that last interacted with matter about 14 billion years ago when the universe was just a few hundred thousand years old. By studying this light, they can study the universe when it was much simpler than it is now. Due to that simplicity, for a given model of the cosmos, the properties of this light can be accurately calculated. For what has become the standard model of the cosmos the agreement between predictions and observations is quite extraordinary. However, this standard model predicts that the current rate of expansion of the cosmos is significantly smaller than what is found by much more direct observation of the expansion. This project is a theoretical investigation of what adjustments to the standard model of the cosmos might be required to bring the predicted expansion rate in line with the observed expansion rate, while maintaining consistency with all other data. The researchers will train graduate students in research, and will develop a board game aimed at improving public understanding of cosmology, expanding awareness and appreciation of various large-scale cosmology projects, deepening understanding of academic science as a human enterprise, and communicating the benefits of a diverse team. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support an investigation of the contents of the universe in a particular target epoch: the two decades of scale factor evolution prior to recombination. The researchers will examine consistency of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data with the standard cosmological model, Lambda Cold Dark Matter (LCDM), and take a "bottom-up" approach to studying possible extensions. They will examine what is allowed, or even favored, and why, with and without the inclusion of distance ladder and baryon acoustic oscillation data. This investigation is important for its discovery prospects, its ability to rule out particular extensions, and its impact on cosmological parameter determination.  It might also point toward a new "dark" ingredient in addition to the dark matter and dark energy that cosmologists already need to make sense of observations of the cosmos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[          Background: For over 20 years now we have had a cosmological model, referred to both as the standard cosmological model and as LCDM, which has been highly successful when used to make predictions about cosmological observations. Remarkably, it is a model that includes two components that are not part of the (extremely successful) standard model of particle physics. These we call dark matter and dark energy. The dark matter is cold, hence the C in CDM, and the dark energy is an unchanging energy associated with every cubic centimeter of space, the symbol for which is the upper case Greek letter Lambda.   In the LCDM model (and in successful cosmological models more generally), the universe used to be in a state much different than the current one. The matter was distributed much more uniformly. It was also hotter and denser, and space was expanding much more rapidly. We can actually see the Universe as it was in this earlier time, at the time of a transition from being filled with a plasma to being filled with a neutral gas, a transition which occurred when the universe was only about 370,000 years old. We refer to this transition as recombination because free electrons are combining with protons, converting charged particles into neutral hydrogen. At this time, the light from the heat that filled the universe could, for the first time, start traveling freely across space. We can see light from the time of this transition that has been traveling for about 14 billion years. We call it the cosmic microwave background (CMB).   We have mapped the CMB across the whole sky. The statistical properties of the intensity (and polarization) variations, revealed with more and more precision over the past two decades, have enabled many tests of the LCDM model (tests it has passed) as well as a precise determination of its six free parameters.   With the model parameters determined (parameters that describe the contents and the initial conditions) we can predict a lot of things, including how rapidly the universe is expanding today, a quantity known as H0. When we compare to our most precise means of determining H0 much more directly (one that does not require assumption of a cosmological model) we get a slightly different number. We will refer to this other method as CDL for classical distance ladder. Taking the uncertainties into account, the difference between the CMB-LCDM H0 and the CDL H0 is highly significant.   Intellectual Merit: If we used a model with a more complex dark sector to interpret the CMB data and to make predictions for H0, the discrepancy might go away. Exploring this possibility was the prime motivation for the scientific work supported by this grant.   It is well known that a model that can have an increased expansion rate in the early universe, prior to and during recombination, could help to make the CMB data consistent with the CDL H0. One of the ways of accomplishing this faster expansion is to have an additional, relatively smooth (not clumpy) material in the universe. Amazingly, the CMB data place strong constraints on the properties of this additional material  properties such as how its density changes as the universe expands. Our work explored these constraints in a fairly general phenomenological model  one much more general than had been done previously.   We found that despite all this additional freedom in the model, there were still tight constraints on the expansion rate prior to and during recombination, that the model could significantly improve the consistency of the CMB and CDL data, and that near-future observations of the CMB should be able to test whether nature is behaving at all like in this new model.   Broader Impacts: This grant was the main source of support for one student who graduated with a PhD in 2023. The code that we developed to explore the implications of data for our model is publicly available and can be used by others.   We developed an educational game and made it available for free at thebigbangboardgame.com. The game has the potential to expose children ages 10 and up to science as an adventure engaged in by human beings like them.
