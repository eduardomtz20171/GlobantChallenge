<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2020, Broadening Participation of Groups Under-represented in Biology. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The research aims to understand how organisms respond to changes in their environment. This is important for accurately predicting the effects of a changing climate. This project will investigate how the sea urchin, Diadema antillarum, responds to warming temperatures. These sea urchins play a vital role in Caribbean coral reef ecosystems, which are severely threatened by environmental change. The research will contribute to the management and conservation of coral reef ecosystems that generate essential ecosystem services to people (e.g., fisheries, recreation, tourism, and protection from tropical storms). Additionally, the Fellow will increase the inclusion of underrepresented groups in biology by mentoring students and providing educational outreach activities at institutions that serve historically underrepresented racial minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates the role of epigenetic processes in providing rapid phenotypic plasticity under changing environmental conditions. The project assesses epigenetic patterns and their connection to varying genotypes, demography, and physiological responses (e.g., righting ability), in sea urchins inhabiting areas that naturally differ in their temperature regimes. A reciprocal transplant experiment will be used to distinguish between local adaptation and acclimation processes, followed by spawning and crossing of adult urchins to investigate the persistence of epigenetic marks across generations. Genome-wide differences in DNA methylation, body size, and thermal tolerance will be compared across larvae that differ in their developmental and parental thermal history exposure. The project will also generate a draft genome for Diadema antillarum. The Fellow will mentor students at Florida International University and the University of Puerto Rico. Additionally, the Fellow will provide educational outreach activities to high school students and their families at a South Florida public high school, the Marine Academy of Science and Technology at Florida International Universityâ€™s Biscayne Bay Campus. Public outreach will also be performed in Puerto Rico with the Sociedad Ambiente Marino conservation organization that will include events in which participants actively interact with the study organism to connect its importance to coral reefs and the value that coral reef ecosystems provide to people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Sea urchins were observed immediately prior to, during, one month after, and one year after the mortality event. High numbers of grossly abnormal and dead urchins were observed during the mortality event. Sea urchin densities in some locations declined by as much as 92% between May and June 2022.

Overall, the pathogen was either absent or found at very low levels within the tissues of grossly normal urchins. Some grossly normal urchins that were sampled immediately prior to or during the mortality event had slightly higher pathogen levels, indicating that they may have been at an early stage of infection.

The amount of time it takes for a sea urchin to right itself (i.e., return to a normal position after being flipped upside down) is important for avoiding predation and is a useful metric for assessing whether the urchins are in good physiological condition. Among grossly normal urchins, righting ability was not significantly affected by time (i.e., during different stages of the mortality event). Righting ability of grossly normal urchins also did not differ between those that were not infected and those with low infection levels detected in their tissues. However, grossly abnormal urchins, all of whom were found to have high levels of the pathogen in their tissues, were not capable of exhibiting a righting response. This indicates that the pathogen appears to impact the water vascular systems of the sea urchins, which are needed to successfully regulate and control their movement.
