<AbstractNarration>A five-day international conference entitled "Reflections on Geometry: 3--Manifolds, Groups and Singularities" is to be held at Columbia University in New York City on June 8-12, 2020.  Research on the three main topics of the conference has proceeded at a remarkable pace, in a multitude of directions, and using diverse methods of study and application.  Many exciting possibilities for current and future research lie at the interface of these areas, with important potential applications in other subfields of mathematics and physics.  The main objective of this conference is to provide a single forum for a comprehensive meeting, which will create many opportunities for cross-fertilization of these blossoming research directions and methods across diverse disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will focus on new developments that highlight connections between these fields, and help create new avenues for collaboration.  All conference participants will benefit from the unusual breadth of this conference, and the opportunity to see connections between topics that first appeared in distinct research fields.  Graduate students and junior researchers will especially benefit by meeting distinguished researchers, gaining perspective, learning the current developments, setting goals for further research, and exploring applications to different fields of mathematics. More details about the conference are available at http://math.columbia.edu/~walterfest/walterfest2020/index.html.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
