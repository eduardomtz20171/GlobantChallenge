<AbstractNarration>This award supports research in relativity and relativistic astrophysics and it addresses the priority areas of NSF's "Windows on the Universe" Big Idea. Black holes and neutron stars are nature's most compact objects and their collisions are a transformative laboratory for fundamental physics and astrophysics. The highly relativistic speeds and strong gravitational fields of black hole and neutron star mergers generate gravitational waves that encode the properties of the objects as they collide: how massive they are, how far away they are, and how fast they are spinning. This project will use the information encoded in the gravitational waves detected by the National Science Foundation's Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) to understand how massive stars live and die, and to help understand the properties of dense matter and the atomic nucleus. This project will drive the development of scientific workflow tools and high-throughput computing that have broad impact across the scientific community. Students will be trained in the tools of data analysis and high-performance computing, which will enable them to become valuable members of the 21st century workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to combine multi-messenger observations of compact objects with nuclear theory, fundamental gravity, waveform modeling, and open data to help answer some of the most pressing questions in the gravitational-wave astronomy, and to prepare for the next generation of gravitational-wave observatories. This project will help to elucidate the equation of state of matter at nuclear densities, and explore whether exotic phases of matter, such as hyperons, kaons, and quark-gluon plasmas reside in the inner cores of neutron stars.  New searches for gravitational-wave sources will determine if our understanding of the compact-object mass and spin distributions is restricted by the limits of current searches for gravitational-wave signals and, possibly, will discover new classes of compact-object binary. This project will use gravitational waves to explore the nature of gravity and constrain or confirm the existence of exotic compact objects in the universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project supported the work of the principal investigator, five graduate students, and two undergraduate students to useneutron stars to measure the nuclear equation of state using gravitational-wave observatories.   Remarkably, scientists still do not have a complete picture of the way that matter behaves at the densities encountered in an atomic nucleus. Neutron stars, compact objects formed in the supernova explosions of massive stars, can help us understand the behavior of matter at nuclear and super-nuclear densities, the so-called "nuclear equation of state."   In a neutron star, gravity is so strong that electrons and protons undergo a process known as inverse beta decay, turning the entire mass of the star into a compact ball of neutrons; essentially an atomic nucleus the size of a city.   This project studied how neutron stars in a variety of astrophysical situations can be used to understand the behavior of nuclear matter. Gravitational-wave observations of neutron stars by the current Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, as well as future observations by the planned Cosmic Explorer detector can reveal the properties of these stars in supernovae explosions and mergers.   Part of the work involved forecasting future equation of state constraints by developing a new algorithm to measure the equation of state from gravitational-wave observations. Using this algorithm, we then created a population of simulated binary neutron star merger signals chosen to explore the currently allowed equations of state, using both a simulated LIGO-Virgo detector network as well as a simulated Cosmic Explorer detector. These analysis guide the design and construction of future observatories allowing them to maximize their sensitivity to nuclear physics.We also studied the ability of Cosmic Explorer, a proposed third-generation gravitational-wave observatory, to detect eccentric binary neutron stars and to measure their eccentricity.   Most neutron stars are expected to have a mass about 1.4 times that of the Sun.Very low mass neutron stars with masses between 0.1 and 1 solar masses, while not expected, are in principle possible and the observation of such a low mass neutron stars need not imply qualitatively new physics. Through this project, we expored the ability of LIGO and Virgo to detect these systems developed a new search method to look for these mergers in Advanced LIGO and Virgo.   Core-collapse supernovae are one of the sources of gravitational waves that could be detected by third-generation gravitational-wave detectors. In this project, weexplored the measurability of the f-mode frequency evolution of proto-neutron star for a supernova signal observed in the third-generation gravitational-wave detectors.   Beyond the astrophysics outcomes, this project has impacted the development of the nations cyberinfrastructure, including improvements to the HTCondor grid-computing infrastructure and the Pegasus Workflow Management system. The work has stimulated the development of SciTokens, CVMFS, XrootD, and other Open Science Grid tools that are in wide use by the scientific community.
