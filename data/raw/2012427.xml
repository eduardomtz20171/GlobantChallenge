<AbstractNarration>Riemannian geometry plays a fundamental role in mathematical physics and geometric analysis, and computational methods for Riemannian geometry have surprisingly many practical applications.  Equations that govern time-varying Riemannian metrics, for example, are prototypes for curvature-driven flows that arise in science and engineering like surface tension-driven flow.  Such equations also underly several algorithms that are used widely in computer graphics, machine vision, and medical imaging.  Examples include algorithms for surface parameterization, texture mapping, and surface registration.  Computational Riemannian geometry also plays an essential role in gravitational wave astronomy, where accurate numerical simulations of Einsteinâ€™s equations are needed to make inferences about gravitational wave signals.  Despite its importance, Riemannian geometry is, in certain respects, underserved by traditional tools of numerical analysis, which are tailored toward problems posed in Euclidean space.  This project centers on developing novel computational methods for Riemannian geometry.  The computational methods will be made freely available in a public repository, and graduate students will participate in their development. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to design and analyze high-order methods for three families of problems in computational Riemannian geometry: (1) the numerical solution of intrinsic geometric flows with finite element methods, (2) intrinsic curvature approximation with finite elements, and (3) the efficient computation of interpolants, geodesics, Riemannian means, and the Riemannian exponential map on matrix manifolds. These three problems are tightly intertwined. The vast majority of geometric flows in Riemannian geometry are curvature-driven flows, so their discretization with finite elements goes hand in hand with the construction of finite element approximations of the Riemann curvature tensor and its contractions. In turn, tensor field and frame field discretizations play an important role in curvature approximation, underscoring the need for efficient algorithms for computations on matrix manifolds. This project aims to design numerical methods for the aforementioned problems that are high-order, provably convergent, and structure-preserving. This project will support one graduate student each year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project developed computational tools for Riemannian geometry, which is a mathematical framework for studying curves, surfaces, and their generalizations. Riemannian geometry plays a central role in many equations from mathematical physics. For example, the Einstein field equations of general relativity, which dictate the curvature of spacetime and tell us how gravitational waves propagate, are a system of partial differential equations posed on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Likewise, the equations that govern rigid body dynamics and fluid dynamics have solutions that can be viewed as geodesics on certain Riemannian manifolds.   The project centered around several tasks within computational Riemannian geometry, including intrinsic curvature approximation with finite element methods, the numerical solution of intrinsic geometric flows with finite element methods, and the design of efficient algorithms for doing computations on matrix manifolds.   One significant result of this project was our development and analysis of curvature approximations on simplicial triangulations equipped with Regge metrics: piecewise polynomial metrics with single-valued tangential-tangential components on element interfaces. We accomplished this first for the scalar curvature in two dimensions, then the scalar curvature in higher dimensions, and most recently the Einstein curvature tensor in arbitrary dimension. We also developed a useful technical tool for analyzing finite element approximations of differential forms with low regularity. In the long run, these tools could provide a stepping stone toward constructing convergent finite element methods for intrinsic geometric flows and the Einstein field equations.   Another result of this project was our development of tools for computing on matrix manifolds, including efficient iterative algorithms for computing fractional powers of matrices. These algorithms allow one to compute, among other things, Riemannian means and geodesic interpolants on certain matrix manifolds. The techniques that we used to derive these algorithms led us to discover some results of independent interest in rational approximation theory.   We also used ideas from Riemannian geometry to design structure-preserving algorithms for computational fluid dynamics. Using the geometric description of fluid flow mentioned above, we constructed what appears to be the first finite element method for magnetohydrodynamics that simultaneously preserves energy, cross-helicity, magnetic helicity, incompressibility, and the divergence-free constraint on the magnetic field, and we constructed what appears to be the first finite element method for heat-conducting viscous flow that respects the balance of energy and the second law of thermodynamics elementwise.   This award also supported the training of graduate students and early career researchers. Under the PI's direction, three master's students completed their master's theses and one Ph.D. student began a Ph.D. thesis that is in progress. The PI also mentored a postdoc who went on to earn a tenure-track position. Lastly, the PI organized seminars and conference minisymposia and volunteered at science competitions for middle and high school students.
