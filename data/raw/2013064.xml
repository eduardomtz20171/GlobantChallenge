<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Carleton DeTar at the University of Utah.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our current understanding of the most fundamental elementary particles and interactions in Nature is encapsulated in the so-called "Standard Model".  Unfortunately, it is incomplete.  For example, it can't explain the dark matter that permeates the Universe.  Thus physicists almost universally believe that still more fundamental particles and interactions are yet to be discovered.  A large experimental search is underway at accelerators, such as the European Large Hadron Collider, to find new particles.  Even if the accelerator energy is not high enough to find them, such new particles will reveal their existence through discrepancies between careful measurements and precise theoretical predictions based on the Standard Model.  Such comparisons are effective only if the residual uncertainties in the predicted quantities are reduced in tandem with improvements in the accuracy of experimental measurements.  Professor DeTar and collaborators are using the most powerful computers and codes to make precise predictions that can be compared with results of experimental measurements, with particular attention to those cases where some tantalizing discrepancies have already been found.  This work is in the national interest in that it furthers our understanding of the most fundamental laws of Nature.  Its broader impacts include the training of students and postdoctoral research associates in programming and utilizing the highest-performance computers, in the management of large data sets, and in the statistical analysis and extraction of physically important information.  Many of Professor DeTar's students and postdoctoral research associates have found jobs that utilize those skills in industrial as well as academic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, this project will use methods of lattice quantum chromodynamics in a precision study of the hadronic environment of heavy-quark decays.  The resulting hadronic decay constants and form factors are then combined with measurements of the decays of mesons containing those heavy quarks.  The project will also involve the calculation of the strong-interaction contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.  The resulting value for the hadronic vacuum polarization will be compared with results of ongoing high-precision experimental measurements of the magnetic moment. Both comparisons provide stringent tests of the consistency of the Standard Model and constraints on theoretical models of new physics.  These calculations are intended to be sufficiently precise that it is now necessary to include the effects of virtual photons. This project will therefore advance our ability to include them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Our current understanding of elementary particles in Nature and their interactions is summarized by the "Standard Model". We know it is incomplete. For example, it doesn't explain the existence of dark matter or dark energy. Thus there is a huge search underway for new particles and interactions. The search involves experiments at large particle accelerators, and it involves modeling and calculations by theorists.  This project is part of the wide-ranging search. It aims to make precise predictions based on the Standard Model so they can be compared with equally precise experimental measurements. Discrepancies between the Standard Model predictions and experimental results will point to the discovery of new physics.   This project focuses on two quantities where there have been tantalizing discrepancies. The first is the "anomalous magnetic moment of the muon" or "muon g-2". The second studies the decay properties of particles containing a heavy bottom or charm quark.    The muon can be thought of as a heavy version of the electron. It spins like the electron, and, as it spins, according to quantum mechanics, it carries with it every elementary particle, including new, as yet undiscovered particles. They all contribute to its magnetic moment. That contribution is called "anomalous".  The magnetic moment is being measured to high precision in the muon g-2 experiment at Fermilab.  The measured value is in substantial disgreement with early predictions of the Standard Model, but without quite enough significance to declare a discovery.    We are using state-of-the-art numerical computations of the Standard Model value of the anomalous magnetic moment to see whether the discrepancy goes away or becomes sharp enough for us to be confident of a discovery. A few years ago we published a result that was good (1.3% confidence), but not good enough to say for sure the discrepancy is there. Since then, we have been engaged in a meticulous analysis that will soon produce a result with a much finer accuracy. We have been comparing several components of the calculation with results from other collaborations around the world. Our results for these components are in good agreement and, in most cases, the most precise to date. See the figure for an example.   Decays of the bottom and charm quark are described by the Standard Model. Again, there have been tantalizing discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. We have been engaged in a long-term calculation of these decays, aimed at a high-precision result to be compared with experimental measurements. We recenty published a paper on decays of the charm quark with the highest precision to date. Our calculations involving the bottom quark are ongoing,   This project supports the work of two postdoctoral research associates who are developing skills in high-performance computing and the statistical analyssi of large datasets. These skills are in high demand in the STEM workplace. One of the postdocs has also been involving undergraduate students in small research problems,. They recently reported results at the American Physical Society's Four-Corners Sectional meeting in Flagstaff, Arizona.
