<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by improving STEM literacy. To this end, the project will explore the effectiveness teaming up STEM and non-STEM majors in project-based summer internships hosted by companies and organizations. The internships will offer paid training to work on sustainability issues identified by the internship hosts.  Important features of the internship program include intensive teamwork and mentoring relationships with strong STEM role models, including peers.  To ensure that students maximize the impact of their internship, the project will provide concurrent training around STEM literacy and professional skills.  The internship program will also enhance existing corporate-academic-community partnerships and build new ones. The variety of skills and perspectives represented in the internship teams will support creative solutions that use STEM to address sustainability issues. It is expected that this project will contribute to preparing both a diverse, highly capable STEM workforce and STEM-literate employees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to: 1) increase access to STEM-related internships for STEM and non-STEM majors;  2) investigate the internship program's impacts on science literacy and STEM-disposition of STEM and non-STEM majors; and 3) develop and improve the internship curriculum to offer instructional modules on science literacy and professional skills, preparing the curriculum for future replication and dissemination. STEM literacy skills will be examined through a validated instrument and embedded assessments of end-of-project talks, tests of scientific literacy skills, surveys, and focus groups. This information will generate knowledge about practices that help diverse students, including those from groups that are underrepresented in STEM, improve their science literacy, science disposition, and understanding of career choices, while developing a replicable model for implementation by other organizations. This project is supported by the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education Program: Education and Human Resources.   The IUSE: EHR program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. This project is in the Engaged Student Learning track, through which the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Hosted by Montclair State University and the PSEG Institute of Sustainability Studies with support from the National Science Foundation, the program involved approximately 50 students each summer in transdisciplinary team-based internships that focused on solving real-world sustainability problems. The students worked in teams made up of five different majors to explore and apply their knowledge. Each team was paired with a corporation or organization and professionals mentored the interns and guided them with their projects, and this included 33 different corporate, government and non-profit organizations hosting 42 teams.&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Both STEM and non-STEM students showed improvements in STEM literacy, especially among Hispanic and female students. The hands-on team projects helped students learn how to combine STEM skills with other areas to use cross-disciplinary collective skills to solve complex environmental issues. Many students reported that they gained a clearer understanding of the types of careers available in STEM and became more interested in these fields. When surveyed, most students rated a moderate (3/5) to large (4/5) gain in clarification of career path, showing significant pre versus post increase for females and Hispanic individuals (</span><span>p</span><span> = 0.014 and 0.015, respectively).</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The program also made a broader impact by focusing on inclusivity in STEM, actively recruiting students from groups that are often underrepresented in these fields, and recruiting students specifically from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), receiving applications from 13 HBCUs and 29 HSIs in the final year of the project. The program achieved a 100% retention rate over the project period, demonstrating its effectiveness in engaging and supporting participants. Through their experiences, students increased their knowledge and developed important professional skills, such as communication, teamwork, and project management. The program provided opportunities for students to practice science communication, develop leadership skills, and build connections with industry professionals. The project contributed to the growth of a workforce with interns prepared to work in STEM organizations.&nbsp;</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The Green Teams produced actionable results for partner organizations and communities. In 2022, interns partnered with the Trust for Public Land to transform an overgrown lot into a clean, safe, and educational space for residents. They conducted research, created a database, and developed graphic designs and a 3D model prototype for an educational exhibit. In 2023, interns collaborated with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to recommend healthy building design strategies and developed a database to track environmental metrics for sustainable furniture and materials. Another 2023 project with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey involved modeling and mapping emergency shut-off valves and hydrants using ArcGIS Pro and Field Maps. The team created predictive models to assist with future infrastructure planning. In 2024, interns worked with the Township of Washington on flood mitigation, conducting a comprehensive hydrological assessment and field surveys that resulted in a flood susceptibility map and identification of high-priority flood zones. Another 2024 project with the Northern NJ Community Foundation focused on green infrastructure in Hackensack, where interns created educational materials and data visualizations. They mapped tree canopy coverage, stormwater management, historical redlining, and heat disparities to identify areas most vulnerable to flooding and heat stress. These projects both delivered practical solutions to sustainability challenges and also provided interns with valuable hands-on experience in applying STEM skills to real-world problems.</span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Overall, the project showed how teamwork and bringing together students from different disciplines can help solve real-world problems while increasing interest and participation in STEM fields. Interns pursue successful careers in industry and many elect to continue to graduate school.
