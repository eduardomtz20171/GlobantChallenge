<AbstractNarration>The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Measurement and Evaluation (SIGMETRICS) 2020 conference will be held at the International Science and Engineering Complex of Northeastern University in Boston, MA from June 8â€“12, 2020. ACM SIGMETRICS 2020 aims to provide a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further our knowledge and understanding of the measurement, modeling, analysis, and design of computing and networked systems. The conference interprets computer systems broadly, including traditional computing systems as well as social networks, data networks, and other types of systems. Contributions containing highly original ideas, new approaches, and/or ground-breaking results are particularly encouraged.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support for about 25 US based students to attend the SIGMETRICS 2020 conference. The support will make possible the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference. Particular attention will be paid to directing support towards various underrepresented population. SIGMETRICS brings together professionals from a wide variety of academic and industrial backgrounds; student participants will thus get the opportunity to interact with mentors and peers of varying gender, ethnicity and background. Students will also benefit from the student-centric events, including a student workshop/panel and a student research competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   SIGMETRICS is the Association for Computing Machinery's (ACM) Special Interest Group (SIG) for the computer performance evaluation community; it holds an annual conference by the same name focused on performance modeling, measurement, and analysis of computer systems. The Sigmetrics 2020 conference was canceled due to the ongoing pandemic, so this grant supported stuents attending Sigmetrics 2021-2023. The Sigmetrics 2021 conference was held online from July 14-18,2021, Sigmetrics 2022 was held in hybrid mode in Mumbai India from June 6-10, 2022, and Sigmetrics 2023 was located in Orlando, FL, USA from June 19-22, 2023, and co-located with the ACM Federated Computing Research Conference (FCRC).     The Sigmetrics 2020 Student Travel Grant supported a total of 59 eligible students (38 for Sigmetrics 2021, 19 for Sigmetrics 2022, and 2 for Sigmetrics 2023) to attend the conferences. This grant fostered intellectual merit and broader impacts within the field.     Intellectual Merit     The grant enhanced the intellectual merit of the Sigmetrics conference by enabling the participation of 59 students over three years (2021-2023) in various formats (online, hybrid, and in-person, respectively). The intellectual merit of the grant is evident through the active engagement of attendees in numerous technical sessions, keynotes, tutorials, workshops, and community events. Interacting with leading researchers and academics at these events provided the students with valuable insights, fostering intellectual growth and expanding their understanding of the latest advancements in their respective fields.     Several of the supported students participated in the annual Sigmetrics Student Research Competition (SRC). The SRC not only offered a platform for these students to present their work but also allowed them to receive constructive feedback from experienced researchers, further elevating the intellectual rigor of their projects. Additionally, many of the supported students presented papers either at the main conference or at workshops. These presentations covered a diverse range of topics, highlighting the grants success in promoting intellectual diversity. The presentations not only showcased the students contributions to the field but also stimulated discussions and collaborations among conference attendees.     Broader Impacts     The Sigmetrics 2020 Student Travel Grant helped to encourage broader participation in the Sigmetrics community. The opportunity to connect with established researchers, industry professionals, and peers has the potential to open doors for future collaborations, research opportunities, and career advancements.     In 2021, the grant supported online conference registration costs for 38 students, comprising 7% Hispanic, 10% Black, 19% White, and 57% Asian. Additionally, 26% of awardees were women, and 2% were nonbinary. Among these awardees, 83% were first-time attendees of Sigmetrics. In 2022, the grant supported conference registration and travel costs for 19 students. Among them, 10 attended in person, and 9 attended virtually; 5 were women. In 2023, the grant, along with the Sigmetrics 2023 Student Travel Grant, supported conference registration and travel costs for seven non-male students (28% of the awardees) and one student from an underrepresented racial minority (4% of awardees).     The supported students came from a diverse set of universities and research groups, both in terms of research area (theory, measurement, systems, and learning) and in terms of university size, geographic location, and focus. These students were also diverse in other ways. Some were from very rural areas or from ethnic minorities in their countries. Some were among the only measurement researchers from their country. Others engaged in service work to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion.     Conclusion     The Sigmetrics 2020 Student Travel Grant significantly contributed to the intellectual merit and broader impact of the conference. By supporting a diverse group of students, fostering high-quality research, and providing opportunities for networking and knowledge dissemination, the grant played a crucial role in advancing the fields of performance modeling, measurement, and analysis of computer systems.
