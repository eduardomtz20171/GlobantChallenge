<AbstractNarration>This proposal funds the research activities of Professors Csaba Csaki, Yuval Grossman, Thomas Hartman, Peter Lepage, Liam McAllister, and Maxim Perelstein at Cornell University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-energy physics is the study of the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions. There are several different approaches to answer the biggest puzzles facing this field.  Extremely precise measurements --- of particle collisions at high energies, of the cosmic afterglow of the Big Bang (the so-called "cosmic microwave background radiation"), and of other signals ---yield new clues as to the interactions of elementary particles and the evolution of the Universe.  Powerful computer simulations can also be used to study the properties of the strong nuclear interactions.  Finally, theoretical studies of gravitational and quantum phenomena in extreme settings, such as near black holes or in the earliest moments of the Universe, can lend insight into theories that join gravity with quantum mechanics.  Pursuing all of these directions, the Cornell Particle Theory group will advance the national interest by promoting the advancement of science in one of its most fundamental directions:  the discovery and understanding of new physical law.  In his research, Professor Csaki will develop and scrutinize models that could provide an explanation of the origin of the masses of fundamental particles, as well as the origin of the observed acceleration of our Universe --- models which can potentially be tested either at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) or at a planned future accelerator.  The research of Professor Grossman will focus on questions related to the unexplained fact that the world is made of only ordinary matter particles, while antimatter is exceedingly rare.  Professor Hartman will explore quantum-mechanical aspects of black holes.  Professor Lepage will use large-scale computer simulations for high-precision studies of strongly-interacting particles --- calculations that are needed for high-precision experiments seeking to detect and quantify new physics. Professor McAllister will study the effects of quantum mechanics in cosmology. Finally, Professor Perelstein will propose and study novel theories of dark matter, a mysterious form of matter which comprises most of the matter in the universe but does not consist of any of the known elementary particles.  He will also investigate applications of machine learning to particle physics.  This project will also have significant broader impacts.  The Cornell Particle Theory group will train graduate students and involve postdocs in their research, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field.  They will also give public lectures on their research results, as well as regular lectures to local high-school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More technically, Professor Csaki will pursue several directions, including new approaches to the cosmological-constant problem and tests of vacuum energy; novel aspects of composite-Higgs, dark-matter, and warped extra-dimensional models; clarification of anomalies via scattering amplitudes or the AdS/CFT correspondence; and the physics of magnetic monopoles.  Professor Grossman will explore flavor physics, including the implications of the recent discovery of CP violation in charm, as well as the indications of anomalies in B decays and rare kaon decays. Professor Hartman will study the connection between entanglement and emergent geometry, and investigate the role of higher topologies in black-hole information. Professor Lepage will continue his work with the HPQCD lattice collaboration to extract important physics from nonperturbative QCD simulations, with a particular emphasis on heavy-quark systems and other high-precision measurements.  Professor McAllister will study flux vacua in compactifications of string theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds, including de Sitter and inflationary cosmologies.  Finally, Professor Perelstein will investigate novel theories of dark matter and dark sectors with non-standard cosmological histories, including their phenomenological consequences, as well as further explore applications of machine learning to collider physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This award funded the research activities of Professors Csaba Csaki, Yuval Grossman, Thomas Hartman, Liam McAllister, and Maxim Perelstein at Cornell University.    The research of the Cornell high-energy theory group, with support from this grant, has led to progress in understanding the fundamental natural laws that govern the Universe, which is one of the perennial goals of physical science. The subjects of study included the nature of space and time; the properties of the elementary particles; proposals for the dark matter that shapes galaxies; and mathematical models of the evolution of the Universe that unite quantum-mechanical and gravitational laws. This project advanced the national interest by contributing to the discovery of new aspects of physical laws, by explaining and interpreting the results of ongoing experiments, and by providing theoretical guidance and targets for the design of next-generation experimental facilities. Over its lifetime, the grant resulted in about 80 scientific publications.    Csaki focused on theories in which the elementary particles interact strongly with each other. He studied quantum mechanical tunneling processes in which the fields form an object called an instanton. Csaki developed new methods for calculating how instantons affect hypothetical ultralight particles called axions, which can affect the properties of neutrons and may be produced in the Sun. He also studied how instantons are related to magnetic monopoles.    Grossman researched how experiments measuring charm quarks can reveal hints of new particles in nature. He also calculated the force communicated by neutrinos.    Hartman investigated how quantum-mechanical theories behave differently when studied at different energies, and he showed that these changes in behavior can be calculated in a theory of gravity. He studied quantum effects for rotating black holes, and also investigated black holes in three-dimensional theories of gravity, which are a starting point for understanding how theories with gravity are related to theories without gravity.    McAllister focused on computing quantum-mechanical effects in string theory, and constructing mathematical models of expanding universes. He developed computational software that can efficiently calculate the effects of hypothetical extra dimensions, so that ongoing measurements in astrophysics and cosmology can be used to test or exclude some theories of extra dimensions.    Perelstein continued to study how methods of machine learning can be used to analyze data from the Large Hadron Collider. To find evidence for new elementary particles, one needs to sift through a large amount of data, most of which only involves ordinary particles, and pick out rare and unusual signals. Perelstein showed how a machine learning technique can efficiently detect such anomalies.    The Cornell group has worked to create broader impacts through education and outreach. Csaki continued his work as a trustee of the Aspen Center for Physics, and has served as chair of an American Physical Society panel charged with improving the postdoc hiring process in high-energy theory. Grossman worked with high school students in Arab communities in Israel, and he also taught in two summer schools in Europe. Hartman participated virtually in the ICTP Physics Without Frontiers Latin American school, lecturing to an international audience of young researchers in under-served regions. He also gave a week of lectures for graduate students at a summer school in Vietnam. All members of the group are deeply involved in training of graduate students and postdocs, many of whom have gone on to leading research positions. Other trainees have redirected their scientific skills to overcome sophisticated problems in industry, thus supporting the technological and economic growth of the nation.
