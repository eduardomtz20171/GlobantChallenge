<AbstractNarration>Recent advances in particle physics and astronomy, including the discovery of gravitational waves, have provided a trove of new observational data about the universe we inhabit and the matter it contains.  The research supported by this grant focuses on developing novel methods of extracting information about the history of our universe from this data and applying these results in order to address fundamental unanswered questions such as how the spatial distribution of matter within our universe came to be the way it is and why our universe contains so much more matter than antimatter.  One particular aim of this research is to better understand the origin and properties of the "dark matter" in our universe - an as-yet mysterious form of matter that neither emits nor absorbs light, but nevertheless makes its presence felt via its gravitational pull on normal, visible matter.  A significant portion of this award will support undergraduate involvement in these research topics, thereby cultivating interest among the next generation of scientists and honing their computational skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program of research supported by this award is organized around two main themes.  One of these themes is to investigate novel methods for uncovering information about the dark sector of our universe and distinguishing between different dark-matter scenarios.  Scenarios involving non-minimal dark-sectors are of particular interest, since the characteristic experimental signatures of dark matter in such scenarios are often qualitatively different from those typically associated with minimal dark sectors, and less thoroughly studied.  The other theme is to investigate how departures from the minimal picture of early-universe cosmology - departures involving, for example, additional cosmological phase transitions, additional unstable degrees of freedom, or additional dynamics related to cosmic inflation or reheating - can be probed or constrained by observation.  This research theme involves identifying novel ways in which observational data - concerning, for example, the matter power spectrum or the properties of the cosmic microwave background - can be used to reveal information about early-universe dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Theoretical particle physics has two main goals. One is to develop new, self-consistent theories to account for experimental results that don't seem to accord with our current picture of how nature works. The other is to determine novel ways in which our experimental colleagues might be able to test such theories in the lab, or using telescopes.  There is a lot we currently don't know about the history of our universe. During the period in which my work was supported by this NSF research award, my research collaborators and I discovered a phenomenon which could have given rise to a wholly new kind of cosmological era shortly after the Big Bang. If such an era indeed took place during the early history of the universe, it could have had a profound impact on what we see through telescopes today --- and perhaps even provide answers to longstanding questions about why our universe looks the way it does. Since our initial discovery, we have studied extensively how a cosmological era of this sort would have impacted things that astronomers will be able to observe and measure in the near future. In addition, my collaborators and I have also have developed several new techniques that experimental physicists can use at particle accelerators in order to distinguish between different theoretical proposals for what the as-yet mysterious "dark matter" in our universe might be. These techniques will help these experimental colleagues to interpret the wealth of new data that will be generated at an unprecedented rate by these accelerators over the next ten years.  Another important aspect of the work that was sponsored by this award is the training of the next generation of America's scientific workforce. Indeed, this award has enabled me to involve a significant number of undergraduate students in active research in theoretical particle physics. These students have not only contributed substantively to the research itself, but have also acquired a variety of valuable transferable skills in the process, including fluency with computer programming and critical-thinking skills.
