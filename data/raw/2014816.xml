<AbstractNarration>During the last decades there has been significant research in understanding how strategic agents in communication, transportation, energy, economic, societal networks make decisions in the presence of uncertainty about other agents' preferences. This research is motivated by a multitude of applications in our ever-connected society and economy, and the realization that assumptions such as fully-informed or fully-compliant agents are untenable in vastly decentralized networks. The design of incentives for resource allocation problems in the presence of strategic agents falls under the research area of mechanism design (MD). There are two issues with the current state of the art in MD. First, it assumes the existence of a central entity accepting bids and being capable of communicating with each agent. Second, it does not adequately address the question of how agents converge to the designed equilibria.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Our overarching objective in this proposal is to create a new subfield of research that addresses these issues in a unified framework. We utilize this framework to design mechanisms that are distributed and have learning (i.e., convergence) guarantees for a sufficiently broad range of agents' behaviors. To achieve our objective, we plan to proceed along a path that blends in fundamental research with targeted applications. In particular, we first investigate the design of distributed mechanisms. We consider two illustrative applications, namely, rate allocation in unicast/multicast-multirate networks and demand management of energy communities. We then investigate distributed mechanisms that incorporate learning guarantees, by which the community reaches an equilibrium. Finally, we study the above two problems in the context of non-Bayesian agents with ``no-regret'' type limited rationality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Besides the two illustrative applications, research to be carried in this project will benefit a broad range of practical fields of large societal impact. Examples include smart energy and infrastructure systems, communication systems, cyber physical and human systems, social and economical systems, to name a few. The research outcomes will be utilized for curriculum development, for training undergraduate and graduate students, and for various outreach activities at the PIsâ€™ institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Many engineering and societal problems can be formulated as resource allocation problems: a number of players compete for a common pool of resource to satisfy their own interests. As these interests are not always aligned with one another, such problems can be formulated as non-cooperative games, whose solutions are the so-called Nash equilibriums (NE), or more precisely, generalized Nash equilibriums (GNE) due to the common resource constraints. Without outside intervention, individual players being self-interested will choose actions to maximize their own payoffs, and the resulting NE allocation will often be unfair and with poor social welfare for the whole group.</p> <p>The focus of this project is to find ways to change the selfish behaviors of the players, to encourage (but not coerce) them to cooperate with each other, and ultimately to achieve fair and socially sound NE resource allocation. This is done via mechanism design, i.e., proper modifications of the players&rsquo; payoff functions by means such as monetary rewards/penalty. Further, oftentimes the players are connected by a communication network where neighboring players can exchange information and/or resource.

Further, many current problems faced by society nowadays are at the essence resource allocation problems. Social issues arise due to the unfair and socially unproductive allocation of public resources. A central scheme of this project is to design mechanisms that can promote cooperation and resource sharing among participants. The outcomes from this project may provide insights on the policy solution of such social issues.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 05/02/2024<br> Modified by: Jianghai&nbsp;Hu</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2014816/2014816_10679668_1714701827885_Pic1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2014816/2014816_10679668_1714701827885_Pic1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Thermal Load Management of Building Clusters"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2014816/2014816_10679668_1714701827885_Pic1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Thermal Load Management of Building Clusters"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Thermal load management problem for buildings clusters formulated as a resource allocation game.
