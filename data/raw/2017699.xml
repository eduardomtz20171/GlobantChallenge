<AbstractNarration>Detecting dark matter in the lab would be transformational for physics, and such a difficult measurement requires providing a foundation for early-career scientists in advanced data analytics.   The science question being pursued is generally acknowledged to be one of the most important questions in particle physics and astrophysics and is key to understanding what makes up the vast majority of the universe.  Effective training in good computing practices is required for major research advances in this field.  The project will consolidate and strengthen training efforts in scientific software development and data analysis within the field of experimental dark matter research.  Scientifically, the training will enable discovery that will come from a world-wide effort consisting of hundreds of junior scientists  searching for  extremely-rare events on petabytes of data - effectively looking for a needle in a haystack the size of Texas.  The project serves the national interest as stated by NSF's mission to promote the progress of science by preparing a workforce trained in cyberinfrastructure, and will support STEM disciplines with critical software training that is much needed both in scientific fields and in industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dark matter community consists of more than a thousand scientists at the frontier of ultra-rare event searches whose efforts support more than twenty different experiments.  Searching for dark matter in multiple ways has resulted in disparate and often inadequate computational training. This project addresses the training problem to maximize impact across the field.  Representing three leading dark matter experiments, the project investigators will develop educational material and training workshops for systematic data science education to ensure early career scientists can harness the data volumes being produced by modern experiments.  The project will host two training workshops per year, toward the goal of developing a community of instructors and also a set of training materials for free distribution and reuse. Beyond domain-specific training in rare-event searches, foundational computational knowledge will be developed when necessary by working with partners such as the Software and Data Carpentries.  The project includes specific goals to engage women and underrepresented minorities in the training activities and broaden their advancement within the field.  Additionally, the project will provide mentors for advanced students through hackathons. These trainings will directly contribute to broader STEM workforce development while training students such that they can pursue careers in data science and/or data-intensive research.  This project is funded by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering and the Division of Physics in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

These communities represent experiments at the smaller scale of particle physics collaborations that were not previously provided advanced training options. These advanced trainings focused on software engineering, data analysis, and especially machine learning given student interest. We focused on advanced training as this filled a gap that was often difficult for universities to fill for their own students if they did not have research software engineers or machine-learning experts at their home institution.    We organized a series of schools, workshops, and visiting fellows programs that directly impacted nearly 200 students while bringing knowledge to communities of thousands of researchers given the nature of Big Science. This work took place in the context of the pandemic, so we organized trainings ranging from size of a single participant or two, to 200 students if virtual, to roughly 30 if an in person training. On the larger event size, we organized the DANCE-ML workshop and training (virtual), and the DANCE/CoDaS@Snowmass school (in person), where both were major successes based on the feedback we received. Additionally, we co-organized events such as the SLAC Summer Institute and CoDaS-HEP '23 to ensure inclusion of students from smaller experiments, especially those from underrepresented groups. Given pandemic restrictions, we also organized a visiting fellow program whereby early career researchers could travel to another institution (often Rice University) for 1 to 3 weeks to learn an advanced computational or machine-learning skill that they could otherwise not learn with supervision at their home institution. These researchers were required to then teach the skills that they learned at their home institution to pay-it-forward, which is a model that was highly effective. Lastly, we incorporated a component to our interactions with early career researchers at the workshops and as part of the Fellow program related to career guidance since this was a unique resource that we could provide that was valued by the researchers.
