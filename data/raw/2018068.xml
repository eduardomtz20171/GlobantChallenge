<AbstractNarration>This award funds research in economic theory. The project seeks to improve our understanding of how social networks shape the spread of opinions, products, and ideas. The core objective is to turn insights from theoretical models into practical guidance on how to conduct targeted seeding, how to design regulations for social media, and how to advertise new products with uncertain quality. The award funds three projects. The first project will develop a framework to study how best to target individuals based on their network positions in order to spread a new idea or innovation. The second project will model the distinctive features of social media markets in an effort to identify inefficiencies and propose potential regulatory solutions. The third project will study the interplay between word-of-mouth advertising and how consumers learn about product quality. Managing the spread of information and misinformation has become a core concern in recent years, and results from these projects will help regulators and business leaders make more effective decisions in this domain. Methods developed in the process may also prove useful in other applications in which individual choices affect a contagion process—for instance, modeling the spread of disease while accounting for changes in human behavior that occur as it spreads. The research therefore has the potential to advance our nation’s capacity to meet current and future challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects contribute to a broader agenda on how to leverage social spillovers to spread innovations and how to manage these spillovers to mitigate the spread of misinformation. The first project will lead to a new approach to optimal targeting in order to disseminate new ideas and innovations. The second will provide a framework to evaluate proposed reg- ulations on social media. The third will help us understand how word-of-mouth marketing conveys information about product quality. While several recent papers demonstrate the efficacy of many network-based interventions, this agenda faces challenges because network data are typically noisy and expensive to gather, and determining optimal policies is computationally hard. Building on methodology that the PI introduced in a previous paper, these projects leverage new results on random graphs to obtain a computationally tractable model that makes predictions based on distributional information about the network structure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project sought to improve our understanding of how social networks shape the spread of opinions, products, and ideas. Several subprojects have contributed towards this goal. The first subproject proposed a novel approach to targeted seeding, offering a strategy to help spread new products or ideas based on less detailed network information than other approaches. This strategy, along with details on how to implement it, are the subject of a paper that is now in the final rounds of review at Econometrica, one of the most selective and well-regarded economics journals. This work was also presented at the ACM conference on economics and computation, a long-standing conference covering work at the intersection of economics and computer science. This grant has helped push forward two additional subprojects studying how one might regulate social media. An important challenge here is that there are different reasons why social media markets might be inefficient, or might promote misinformation. One of these projects focuses on mistaken inferences that people might draw because it is too difficult to keep track of information sources---the same information repeated twice by different people may well be interpreted as two independent information sources, and this can lead to overconfident beliefs. A second project focuses on how social media increases incentives to free-ride---since learning from friends and acquaintances is so much easier now, fewer people find it worthwhile to do independent research, and collectively we gather less information as a result. Further work is continuing on these two subprojects with the goal of informing public policy.     Last Modified: 10/02/2024       Submitted by: EvanSadler]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
