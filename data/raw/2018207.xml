<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the Natural History Museum (NHM) of Los Angeles County Foundation for the purpose of acquiring a scanning electron microscope (SEM) for research, education, and exhibition programs.   The SEM will replace an earlier model that served the Museum well for nearly 20 years.  The NHM is a research and educational institution that serves one of the nation’s most ethnically diverse cities and largest school district.  NHM’s Education branch will leverage the new microscope to aid in communicating science to the public.  Education and training activities will include classes taught at graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels in affiliation with several local universities and high schools.  A planned adjacent exhibit will incorporate the SEM into a public-facing setting that uses graphics, images, and live-feed video to show visitors how images in the sciences are produced and used.  Other societal benefits include raising the scientific literacy of the general public via outreach activities and through in-house classes and demonstrations for visiting teachers and school groups of all ages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new microscope will be used in a wide variety of scientific research fields, including evolutionary morphology, vertebrate and invertebrate biology and paleontology, systematic and phylogenetic biology, mineral sciences, and more.  SEM images will be used in a diverse array of publications, books, and scientific reports.   Results from research activities will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and through national and international scientific meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This grant (NSF award 2018207) allowed the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County to replace its aging scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a new machine, a JEOL JSM-IT200LA, capable of greater magnification and resolution. Electron microscopes differ from light microscopes in providing far greater magnification and resolution. The new SEM has already facilitated new research and teaching programs and will continue to enable scientists to conduct a wide variety of research projects in areas as diverse as mineral sciences, ornithology, entomology, paleontology, marine biology, and many other disciplines. Importantly, and as part of the grant agreement, the new SEM was installed in a public-facing area of the museum, such that visitors can watch real science being performed and are able to pose questions to the investigators using the SEM. A corresponding adjacent exhibit explains to visitors the advantages of electron microscopy over light microscopy and explains the differences in these two approaches to viewing the natural world at high magnifications. Selected museum scientists and their objects of study are incorporated into the new exhibit. Students, teachers, and other public groups representing a wide range of ages are able to visit and observe scientists using the SEM in real time, expanding our role as a natural history museum of and for the people of the Los Angeles area.
