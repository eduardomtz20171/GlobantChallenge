<AbstractNarration>This project addresses a high priority need for water research communities: interoperability among a wide variety of data sources and models, and integration of different computational models into water research communities.  The project will develop an open and sustainable software framework enabling integration of hydrologic data and models for interdisciplinary teamwork and discovery.   The models and datasets cover fields such as hydrology, biology, environmental engineering and climate.  The project also addresses one of the key issues for extreme-scale computing:  scalable file systems.  The collaboration draws upon computing, modeling, and hydrology expertise at six institutions: University of Pittsburgh, University of Iowa, Ball State University, North Carolina State University, Indiana University, and the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. (CUAHSI).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project develops CyberWater, a community-driven software framework that integrates a wide range of models and datasets across disparate temporal and spatial scales. The CyberWater framework allows scientists to bypass challenges associated with model and dataset complexity.  The project designs a model agent tool enabling users to generate model agents for common model types without coding, and integrates multiple existing software codes/elements that provide for broad-scale use.  To develop such a diverse modeling framework, the project brings together hydrologists, climate experts, meteorologists, computer scientists and cyberinfrastructure experts.  The project builds upon an existing prototype developed by the lead investigator;  basic elements for the system were developed, consisting of plugged-in models and data sources with corresponding agents and a workflow engine allowing user workflow control.  The prototype was successfully demonstrated for two models, making use of datasets plugged in from NASA, USGS and CUAHSI.  For the current project, new models and datasets are added to the framework; the ability to use high performance computing resources is also incorporated.  The team will use the CUAHSI HydroShare System to distribute CyberWater software and its associate model agents, including instructions on how to establish a local CyberWater environment, models and model agents. The project will enable substantial scientific advances for water related issues, and the solution can be applied to other research disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure is jointly supported by the NSF Directorate for Geosciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Project Outcomes     We have performed a number of activities and achieved our project objectives to provide a use case to study the impacts of regional climate change on water supplies and carbon fluxes in the U.S. within the CyberWater. Our major outcomes are summarized below.     We tested the WaSSI model under four climate scenarios and preparation of the testbed package, which includes the source code, configurations, all inputs and sample output, and the case description file for case studies based climate simulations that were previously performed. We provided the WaSSI package to Prof. Liangs team at Univ. of Pittsburgh (PITT) for its integration into the CyberWater system.  We prepared for the input and sample output files, configurations, and documentations for use cases using WRF and WRF/Chem models. We provided these documents along with a testbed to Prof. Liangs team at PITT and other team members.  We helped recruiting participants from the atmospheric community for the two training workshops for CyberWater on April 8 and May 21, 2021. Those workshops provided excellent training opportunities for researchers from hydrologic and atmospheric communities.  We completed the simulations of the ecohydrological response to climate change over the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and in the states of California (CA) and North Carolina (NC) using WaSSI with inputs from WRF/Chem under two climate change scenarios projected by Technology Driver Model (TDM) under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (IPCC SRES) A1B and B2.  We are working on a draft paper on WaSSI application over CONUS, CA, and NC.  We completed the development of a journal paper on WaSSI application over CONUS, CA, and NC under the TDM scenarios, which will be submitted to a journal soon.     Our major findings are summarized below.   The individual and combined impacts of climate change (GHGs) and air pollutant control on key ecohydrological processes from 2001-2010 to 2046-2055 under A1B and B2 are investigated over the CONUS. The different ecohydrological responses driven by higher horizontal grid spacing of regional climate data are also examined. The major findings are as follows:     Over the CONUS, air pollutants control is projected to increase precipitation over the east but reduce precipitation over the west and central regions. Climate and air pollutant changes tend to suppress runoff in central US, increasing ET, ecosystem productivity, and carbon sink over the eastern and southwest regions. Air pollutants control could interact with regional climate and cause diverse ecohydrological responses under different climate conditions. Comparing to TDM A1B, our results suggest that more stringent air pollutants control (TDM B2) would increase precipitation and runoff over the east and west under the historical climate but might suppress runoff in the east and the central US under the future climate.  Local climate and ecohydrological responses to climate and air pollutants changes are sensitive to the horizontal grid spacing of the regional climate model.
