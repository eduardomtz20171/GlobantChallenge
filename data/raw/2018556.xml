<AbstractNarration>This CC* planning and research alignment project (CRIA) project is led by researchers from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC), Tennessee Technological University (TTU), and Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU). The mission is to build a regional Cyberinfrastructure consortium to advance collaborative computing research in Middle Tennessee, building on the team's expertise in computer and cyber systems. Middle Tennessee is an underserved but growing region of the nation that combines rural, suburban, and urban areas and sits at a nexus of major transportation routes and commerce in the Southeastern United States. The project is also improving regional workforce development, devising and implementing an innovative plan to broaden participation in computing in the surrounding region, and building interdisciplinary proposal teams to seek external funding to support educational and research activities of consortium members. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;UTC, TTU, and MTSU have complementary strengths further strengthened by consortium partners. MTSU, for example, has a strong agriculture component to their research endeavors UTC is the strongest of the three teaming institutions in computational science. Sharing information, cyber resources, expertise, and forming collaborative groups will enhance personnel at each member campus.  A major goal of this CRIA project is to intensively study approaches to broadening participation in computer/computational science in order to develop and implement a regional plan for recruitment, engagement, and retention of students from underrepresented groups. The team is also committed to improving regional workforce development, which will have a broader impact on students within the teaming institutions and the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Middle Tennessee is an underserved but growing region of the nation that combines rural, suburban, and urban areas and sits at a nexus of major transportation routes and commerce in the Southeastern United States. This CC* planning and research alignment project (CRIA) project was designed to enhance Middle Tennessee in several aspects of cyber infrastructure. It was led by researchers from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC), Tennessee Technological University (TNTECH), and Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU). The mission was to build a regional Cyberinfrastructure consortium to advance collaborative computing research in Middle Tennessee, building on the team's expertise in computer and cyber systems, as well as foster interactions and collaborations between and among regional faculty members. This key goal was fully achieved, and the principal faculty involved plan to continue engaging on advanced cyber infrastructure through regional collaborations and further R&D and teaching efforts.      Despite the COVID pandemic, this effort created interdisciplinary proposal teams to seek external funding to support educational and research activities of consortium members. A particularly successful activity were workshops that supported the interests of the three universities faculty - Data Sciences hosted by MTSU and Quantum (Day 1) and Cyber security (Day 2) hosted by UTC. A notable outcome was the development of a successful proposal team (UTC, MTSU, TNTECH, Auburn, and Fisk), that received a follow-on Exlent proposal for QISE Training (NSF # 2322590) that was funded in Fall 2023, and included a diverse team of scientists and engineers. This successful Exlent effort advanced this efforts goal of enhancing workforce development in Middle Tennessee.      UTC, TNTECH, and MTSU brought complementary strengths to this effort, MTSU, for example, has a strong agriculture component to their research endeavors UTC is the strongest of the three teaming institutions in computational science while MTSU is strongest in data sciences. TNTECH is strong in data sciences, AI, and high-performance computing. Sharing information, cyber resources, expertise, and forming collaborative groups enhanced personnel at each member campus. Significant mentoring of TNTECH and MTSU by UTC personnel on CC* proposals and campus infrastructure plans was part of the effort. Significant mentoring of junior faculty also occurred as a byproduct of the collaborations and multi-university interactions.      Another goal of this effort, which was to prepare for a regional network proposal via CC*, is in the process of being realized (with a targeted submission date of April 2024) by a team lead at TNTECH, but inclusive of regional partners in Middle Tennessee including UTC and MTSU.
