<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Mobile money has been shown to reduce aggregate poverty and improve outcomes for households and businesses.  However, not everyone has equal access to this important economic tool.  In low income communities, women lag behind men in participation in both mobile money and labor markets.  This research project will use experimental methods to study how discrimination against women in the mobile money market affects their labor market participation, human capital formation, and other social outcomes.  It also studies whether employing women as mobile money agents decreases labor market  discrimination against women generally and improves their social outcomes.  The results of this research will provide guidance on policies to decrease labor markets against women but could also provide mechanisms to decrease poverty and reduce income inequality.  Hiring women as mobile money agents offers an opportunity to increase economic opportunities for women, change social attitudes towards women's labor force participation, and improve their access to mobile money.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research uses a randomized controlled trial to measure the causal effects of employing women as mobile money agents on the economic and other social outcomes in low income environments.  It also studies the effects of work on the incomes, skill accumulation, and autonomy of women compared to men; and whether the availability of female mobile money agents increases the use of mobile money by female customers.  The research will study how female labor supply responds to the number of women working as mobile money agents by randomly assigning subsidies to 500 shops for hiring either male or female employees.  On the demand side, the researchers will randomize the digitization of loan repayments at 90 BRAC branches, which increases the demand for mobile money by female customers.  The results of this research will not only provide guidance on policies to decrease labor market discrimination against women but could also decrease poverty as well as reduce income inequality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project was designed to contribute to the literature on women's economic empowerment and on the role social norms and expectations may play in constraining women's labor force participation, using a randomized controlled trial in the mobile money sector in Bangladesh. Mobile money is an important sector because it generates household and agregate economic benefits, but in Bangladesh, women are disproportionately excluded as either users or providers of mobile money. Therefore, we designed an experiment to employ women in businesses that offer mobile money services, in order to measure the effects of women's participation on several outcomes: their own economic outcomes, decision-making authority within their households, and skill accumulation; the attitudes of business owners and family members of employees about the abilities of and demand for hiring women; and the use of mobile money by women who are customers in markets served by female mobile money agents relative to only male agents.    The experiment recruited owners of mobile money businesses that were interested in expanding by hiring an employee, if the initial wage bill was subsidized. Each business owner (all were male) was asked to identify two men and two women who he would be willing to have as an employee in the shop. The research team then randomly determined whether a business owner would receive a subsidy to hire an employee or not, and if so, which of the four candidate employees was to be hired. This allows comparisons between businesses that have employees and do not; between businesses that have male employees and those that have female employees; and between candidates who do and do not receive jobs in the mobile money sector.    The project faced substantial delays because of Covid-19 and because the initially-contracted survey firm failed to renew its registration to do business in Bangladesh. The research team continued to engage with local partners throughout the delays, and even fielded initial baseline surveys. However, the delays meant that some of the businesses and employees recruited for the study in early 2020 were no longer available when field work could finally begin, so a new round of recruitment and baseline surveying was necessary. The first wave of the intervention began in October 2023, when nearly 100 businesses were randomly assigned to a hiring subsidy treatment condition. Of the 70 businesses assigned to hire an employee, the designated individual began working as agreed in 69. Two months later, 68 of the employees are still working. Additional outcome data are not available at this point; field work and data collection using funding from other sources is ongoing.    Baseline surveys indicate meaningful differences in business owners' perceptions of male and female employees. Business owners anticipate that it is more difficult to recruit women, and that women will require more training and remain on the job for less time. They also consistently rate men's skills and abilities higher than women's, and appear to penalize women even conditional on measured skill. One objective of the project is to learn how business owners update these beliefs as a result of their experience employing men or women.    While the results of the experiment are not yet available, the project has contributed to the careers of women on the research team. The PhD student whose work was funded by this grant has completed her PhD and secured relevant employment; her analysis of baseline data about candidate employees' experiences with intimate partner violence was one chapter of her doctoral dissertation. The PI for this grant has taken on increasing responsibilities in the economics profession, including co-directing a highly visible research program on Gender in the Economy. She has also expanded the pipeline program she directs for undergraduate students whose backgrounds and identities are underrepresented from the economics profession, and often presents aspects of this project's design and implementation challenges to students involved in the pipeline program as examples of ways that economists study topics that affect policy and contribute to the understanding and wellbeing of marginalized groups.
