<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation and the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs. Rutgers University Newark is acquiring a single crystal X-ray diffractometer to support Professor Frieder Jaekle and colleagues: Roger Lalancette, Michal Szostak, Demyan Prokopchuk and Trevor Tyson from the New Jersey Institute of Technology. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles.  The instrument acquisition provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. In addition, the diffractometer has broad impact on teaching and training, outreach activities, and graduate and undergraduate research at Rutgers University Newark and regional partners such as the New Jersey Institute of Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the X-ray diffractometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. The instrument acquisition impacts the characterization of synthetic inorganic and organic materials to develop new catalysts to advance manufacturing for optoelectronic applications. The instrumentation is also used for studying catalysts made from main group Lewis pairs and amide cross-coupling by nitrogen-carbon bond activation.  In addition, the research team benefits from the instrument by being able to explore transition-metal catalyzed reactions of carboxylic acids and multiferroic complex oxides. The diffractometer is also used to characterize products relevant to molecular catalysis for sustainable energy conversion and compounds for chromophore-semiconductor interfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University-Newark (RU-N), in collaboration with neighboring New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), purchased a Dual Source single crystal X-ray diffractometer (XRD) to support research, education and outreach efforts by faculty at RU-N and NJIT, as well as academic/industrial collaborators throughout northern New Jersey and beyond. X-ray crystallography plays a critically important role in the accurate determination and visualization of structure of new crystalline compounds and materials at the molecular level.   Research Innovations: Research has been enabled in areas that span organic, organometallic, inorganic, polymer and materials chemistry, earth and environmental sciences, and solid-state physics. These research efforts have had profound implications on the development of new pharmaceuticals, innovative polymers, sensors and bioimaging tools, luminescent materials, optoelectronic devices, organic photovoltaics, and magnetic materials. Well over 1000 crystal structure datasets have been acquired over the past three years, benefiting the research of 30 students from more than 10 research groups at RU-N, NJIT, other institutions and local industries.   Student Training:Graduate students and postdoctoral associates have been trained to operate the instrument independently. A graduate course in X-ray crystallography was developed and offered at RU-N; a 3-session module on X-ray crystallography with hands-on training was introduced in the Inorganic and Materials Chemistry undergraduate laboratory course at RU-N; and a 4-credit combined laboratory and lecture course was developed and taught at NJIT. In addition, numerous undergraduate students have been directly engaged in research based on X-ray crystal structure analyses. A mini-symposium on X-ray crystallography was held at Rutgers University to offer advanced training and allow researchers to discuss new developments in the field of X-ray crystallography.   Outreach: The facility director introduced students from minority-serving high schools to X-ray crystallography as part of outreach programs at RU-N. In addition, visiting high school science teachers worked with graduate students at RU-N to develop lesson plans for high school courses.
