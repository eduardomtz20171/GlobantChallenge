<AbstractNarration>This award is supported by the Major Research Instrumentation, the Chemistry Research Instrumentation programs and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). Idaho State University is acquiring a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer equipped with an automatic sample changer to support Professors Andrew Holland, Rene Rodriguez, Caryn Evilia, Courtney Jenkins, Srinath Pashikanti and other colleagues. This spectrometer allows research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as permitting study of biologically relevant species. In general, NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of students in chemistry and biochemistry including underrepresented students and those with disabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award of the NMR spectrometer is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels. It especially facilitates studies of the structures of peptides produced by microorganisms that grow in or can tolerate saline conditions (halophiles) and for preparing chiral aminobutenolide synthons derived from the aminoacid L-serine. The instrumentation is also used in investigations of molecular precursors for earth-abundant semiconducting nanomaterials of relevance to manufacturing. In addition, it provides information to aid analyses and modifications of polysulfide materials and for replacing chalcogens in new metal and hydrogen bonding organic frameworks. The spectrometer is also used to characterize natural products found in the indigenous flora of the intermountain west.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
