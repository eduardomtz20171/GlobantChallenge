<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[Advances in exosuit technologies are enabling the use of powered assistance to enhance walking performance in healthy individuals and assist individuals who exhibit gait pathologies, e.g. individuals with stroke.  Unlike rigid exoskeletons, exosuits are lightweight and use soft materials that provide a comfortable and unobtrusive fit with the body. A pack worn at the waist uses battery-powered motors to generate forces that are transmitted to the ankle and hip.  In spite of demonstrated success in decreasing the energy needed to walk, it remains challenging to tune exosuit assistance patterns for individual users. Thus, the long-term goal of this work is to enable individualized assistance that can adapt in real time to a user’s unique gait patterns and to the environment. To do this, novel sensors, termed shear wave tensiometers, will be used to track adaptations in knee and ankle muscle loading that arise when assistance is provided by a powered ankle exosuit.  Studies will be performed to determine how different exosuit assistance control patterns modulate internal muscle loading under varied walking conditions, including with  and without exosuit assistance, with and without carrying a load (backpack) and walking in an outdoor/real-world environment (declines, inclines and variable walking speeds.)  Theses studies will enhance the fundamental understanding of neuromuscular responses to exosuit assistance and thus enable human-in-the-loop implementations that adapt assistance based on the needs of an individual. Educational and outreach impact will be achieved by using fundamentals underlying the robotic, biomechanics and sensor technologies developed in this project as a platform for engaging K-12 students in STEM. Simplified versions of the exosuits and sensors will be incorporated into the annual engineering outreach event at the University of Wisconsin-Madison which reaches thousands of K-12 students and their teachers every year. Also, the Soft Robotics Toolkit hosted by Harvard will be used to create engaging content that describes human-machine interaction, biomechanics, physiology and gait.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to use novel tissue load sensors, termed shear wave tensiometers, to investigate biomechanical adaptations to exosuit assistance within and beyond the laboratory environment.  Though current exosuit technologies have been shown to lower the metabolic cost of walking in healthy subjects and improve propulsion, ground clearance, and symmetry in stroke survivors, the extent of these benefits varies widely across subjects.  The project builds on a new collaboration between the lab that invented the tensiometer method to directly gauge tendon loading by measuring the propagation speed of shear waves along the tendon’s axis (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and a lab that is recognized for leadership in developing the next generation of soft exosuits (Harvard.)  The Research Plan is organized under three aims, with each aim being evaluated in 10 human subjects.  The FIRST Aim is to develop and incorporate a wearable shear wave tensiometer into an ankle exosuit to continuously monitor Achilles tendon loading during prolonged treadmill walking trials. Ankle joint torque determined from tensiometer measurements will be compared to measurements based on motion capture.  The result of this aim will be a validated wearable sensor for quantifying changes in tendon tissue loading induced by exosuit assistance.  The SECOND Aim is to evaluate relationship between ankle exosuit assistance magnitude and change in muscle-tendon loading during walking with and without added mass.  Results of this aim will provide novel insights into the relationship between exosuit assistance and biological soft tissue loads, with expectations that the tested variables (exosuit force, exosuit timing, and added mass) will have various effects on the user’s muscle-tendon load. The THIRD Aim is to evaluate the effect of ankle exosuit assistance on muscle-tendon loading while walking in an outdoor circuit that includes inclines, declines, comfortable speed and fast walking.  Measurements include tendon loading with the mobile tensiometer, muscle kinematics with ultrasound, and biomechanics and suit data with suit IMUs and load cells. Results of this aim are expected to demonstrate that, similar to how a motion capture and force plate setup in a lab environment allows for estimating joint moments, the suit sensors and tensiometer will allow for evaluating joint kinematics and tendon kinetics in outdoor environments. Success of the project is expected to lead to a new design of exosuits with integrated tensiometer sensors, produce new understanding of biomechanics with exosuits, and potentially inform optimization of personalized wearable exoskeletons for clinical and/or aged populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

In this study, we used shear wave tensiometers to characterize the modulation of Achilles tendon force with load carriage and exosuit assistance at the ankle. Locomotion requires careful coordination across the various joints and muscles of the body, which can be disrupted after neuromotor injuries such as stroke. People poststroke often have weakness in their paretic, or more impaired, ankle plantarflexors and a corresponding reliance on the hip joint to generate sufficient forward propulsion. The field of robotic rehabilitation has developed wearable systems that provide joint- and task-specific training for survivors of stroke, and in turn, increase use of the ankle muscles. However, capturing ankle use at the plantarflexor level remains a challenge with conventional tools given the unknown relative contributions of the dorsiflexor muscles. Moreover, variability across individuals complicates the interpretation of user response to these robotic interventions.</p> <p class="float-left">Intellectual Merit: In a healthy population, we saw that when walking (1.25 m/s) unassisted on a treadmill with load carriage weights of 15 and 30% of body weight, peak Achilles tendon force increased by 11 and 23%, respectively. Ankle exosuit assistance significantly reduced peak Achilles tendon force relative to unassisted, although the magnitude of change was variable across participants. Peak Achilles tendon force was significantly correlated with peak ankle torque for unassisted walking across load carriage conditions. However, when ankle plantarflexor assistance was applied, the relationship between peak tendon force and peak biological ankle torque was no longer significant. An outdoor pilot study was conducted in which a wearable shear wave tensiometer was used to measure Achilles tendon wave speed and compare across an array of assistance loading profiles. Reductions in tendon loading varied depending on the profile, highlighting the importance of in vivo measurements of muscle and tendon forces when studying and optimizing exoskeletons and exosuits. In individuals poststroke, we used standard biomechanical analysis as well as shear wave tensiometry in five people to gain insight into user-specific ankle and hip adaptations in response to three levels of targeted plantarflexion exosuit resistance. We show that at a group and individual-level, evidence suggests a shift in biomechanical strategy from relying on the hip to using the ankle to modulate propulsion, with a subset of participants completely shifting to the ankle by the end of training. This work represents a step towards exploring more individualized methods for characterizing user response during adaptation to wearable robotic training interventions.</p> <p>Broader Impacts: The results of our work is encouraging in that we are able to directly quantify tendon loading changes with exosuit assistance, a metric which we believe is important for the efficacy of exosuits and exoskeletons in real world environments. Designing for reduction in MTU forces not only may reduce muscle fatigue, but also injury risk associated with elevated levels of soft tissue stress. The outcomes of this research are directly translational to clinical populations. Exoskeletons may serve as assistive technologies in individuals struggling with gait impairments or recovering from musculoskeletal treatments. By using the local mechanism of tendon loading in the control of wearable robotic devices, we expect that the system will be able to adapt to the environment in a rapid manner as the individual changes their gait. We developed a diversity-promoting National Biomechanics Day event for local high school students that may not typically have exposure to biomechanics research and ensure that school districts interested in participating would have the necessary support. The cross-institutional collaboration provided unique professional development opportunities. Grad students and postdocs were involved in the coordination of IRB protocols between UW and Harvard.
