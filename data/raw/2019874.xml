<AbstractNarration>This project greatly improves scholars’ and practitioners’ understanding of how governments can successfully implement disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies—policies that are fundamental to fostering and sustaining more resilient communities.  Specifically, it creates new knowledge about the factors and conditions that increase or decrease public support for such key DRR policies as building codes and construction regulations.  Researchers at Florida International University (FIU) and Vanderbilt University will collect and analyze public opinion data from 17 countries (16 Latin American and Caribbean countries and the U.S.) on experiences with major hazard events, perceptions of future risk, and—crucially—support for DRR policies.  Researchers will also look closely at whether and how people’s views change after experiencing a disaster, and the different forms that such experiences may take.  The project advances scientific understanding of the efficacy and social sustainability of DRR policy implementation, creating an open-access database available to disaster researchers and policymakers everywhere.  It also promotes research community cooperation across academic disciplines and will contribute to creating, in the U.S., a more diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce.   Perhaps most importantly, this research helps support strategic efforts in the U.S. (and abroad) to strengthen policies and programs to reduce human and economic losses from disasters.  It will also serve U.S. foreign policy interests—including economic, humanitarian and security interests— since hazard events in Latin America and the Caribbean affect U.S. investment, trade, travel, foreign assistance, immigration flows and patterns, and, ultimately, national security.  Furthermore, this project will increase public engagement with and appreciation of science and technology, as researchers will disseminate public-facing reports on key findings about hazard event experiences, public support for risk reduction, and “windows of opportunity” for achieving enhanced building survivability and safety.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research for this project will proceed in two phases.  In Phase 1, the project team will collect individual-level data on risk perception, attitudes towards risk reduction, and support for DRR policies and enforcement in the 17 countries via a module of DRR questions placed on the 2021wave of Vanderbilt University’s highly-regarded AmericasBarometer survey. Using multi-level mixed-effects regression-style analysis (and controlling for a variety of individual and contextual variables), researchers at FIU and Vanderbilt will test hypotheses on the effects of three sets of factors on support for DRR policies and practices: (1) Disaster risk (perception of the likelihood, severity, and type of hazard events; perception of risk as individual or general; national and local hazard risk profiles); (2) Experience with disasters (as an individual/family, community, or nation); and (3) Governance (trust in government; perceptions of effectiveness / integrity in DRR; personal experience with corruption; national levels of corruption). While these multi-country results are valuable on their own, they also serve as a baseline for understanding how disasters themselves might shape public support for DRR.  In Phase 2, the research team will select one LAC country affected by a major hazard event and home in on the impact of experiencing such events: whether disasters as “focusing events” shift public opinion and help open “windows of opportunity” for improving DRR policies and their implementation.  The team will deploy post-event surveys and compare pre- vs. post-event public opinion; assess the extent and duration of any changes; and analyze causes of change over time at the individual level.  Project findings will provide critical new insights into when and how governments, the private sector, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders could improve DRR policies that save lives and protect property.  Finally, this research will advance knowledge in several fields of scholarship, including public opinion, public policy, the social psychology of risk, and the multidisciplinary study of disasters.&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF’s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation’s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project sought to improve our understanding of how governments can more successfully implement disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies, policies that are fundamental to fostering and sustaining more resilient communities. In 2021, the project collected and analyzed data on public opinion regarding past disaster experiences, the risk of future disasters, and support for disaster risk reduction policies in 17 countries16 Latin American and Caribbean, or LAC countries, and the U.S.with a sample size of more than 25,000 interviews. The project later collected additional survey data from one country, Mexico, in the aftermath of a major hazard event. That event was Hurricane Otis, which, in late October 2023, made landfall near the city of Acapulco as a Category 5 storm. Data was collected via 2,200 interviews, conducted in two survey waves, timed roughly six months apart.     At the hemispheric level, about 62% of respondents in the LAC region said that they or an immediate family member had experienced a disaster at some point in their lives. What is more, fully 70% of respondents in the LAC region expressed support for DRR policies, agreeing that governments should spend more on these policies, even at the expense of other policies and programs. Here, Haiti stands out (with 91% support for DRR policies), followed by the Dominican Republic (with 82% support for DRR policies).    [Fig. 1]    However, when analyzed cross-nationally (and controlling for other factors), project researchers did not find that living in a higher-risk country leads to higher levels of support for DRR policies.     At the level of individual attitudes and perceptions, regression-stye analysis revealed that, in Latin America and the Caribbean, personally experiencing a disaster in the past (or having a family member with such an experience) is associated with greater present-day support for DRR policies. But results also suggest that the effect of "experiencing" a disaster on support for DRR policies is a social phenomenon as well: that is, individual views on DRR are shaped by the perception that the wider community or society has experienced a disaster, even if one was not affected personally.         Indeed, after a major hazard event, public support for disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies is likely to increase, if only temporarily. Evidence from Mexico after Hurricane Otis suggests that this increased support is of limited duration, lasting for a period of weeks or months, not years. On a 0-1 scale, average support for DRR policies in Mexico as measured in June 2021 was 0.63. That support reached 0.73 in November 2023, just weeks after the hurricane, but fell to 0.69 when measured six months later, in April 2024.     [Fig. 2]    Regression-style analysis of this recent data from Mexico also supports the projects earlier cross-national findings about disaster experience as a social phenomenon. Though support for DRR policies did increase at the aggregate level after a major hazard event, variation in support at the individual level was not associated with how severely that individual had been impacted by the event.        Further analysis of the 2021 cross-national data, using structural equation modeling, indicated that experiencing a disaster may increase a persons support for DRR policies via causal mechanisms that are both direct (disaster experience increases support for DRR policies) and indirect (disaster experience increases risk perception, which in turn increases support for DRR policies).        Finally, in addition to disaster experience and perceptions of risk, project researchers found that trust in government and perceptions of government integrity (that is, lower expectations of corruption) were also important predictors of support for DRR policies across the region.        The impact of this project goes beyond the research teams findings to date. By collecting this data and creating an open-access cross-national dataset available to disaster researchers and policymakers everywhere, the project will continue to advance scientific understanding of the social sustainability of DRR policy implementation well past the end of the project period. What is more, the project fostered research community cooperation across academic disciplines and contributed to the development, in the U.S., of a more diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce.         The project also provided a framework for governments at all levels (local to national) and other stakeholders (NGOs, interest groups, international aid agencies) to better understand the timing of opportunities to strengthen and improve the implementation of DRR policies and practicesand to build public support for those efforts.
