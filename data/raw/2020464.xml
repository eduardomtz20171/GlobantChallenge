<AbstractNarration>Nanopore DNA sensing is an emerging technology, and has recently been developed to detect both the DNA primary sequence and epi-genetic information (such as methylation), which is crucial to both fundamental biology and precision medicine.. However, high-speed and accurate DNA methylation detection in nanopores still lags behind. This is attributed to an insufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) resulting from the inherent large electrical capacitive noise from the conductive silicon (Si) and also the complex DNA dynamic interaction with nanopore surface.  This project proposes a multidisciplinary research plan to address the fundamental challenges in high-speed and low-noise biomolecular sensing in a solid-state nanopore device. The new design combines electrical and optical sensing on a single sensor platform to improve the sensing accuracy. It utilizes crystalline sapphire as an insulating substrate and integrates large-bandgap titanium oxide thin film as the sensing element to minimize both the electronic and optical noise. The demonstration of DNA methylation detection will prove the feasibility of our TiO2/sapphire nanopore sensors in detecting complex molecular structures that will have broad impact on molecular marker detection and molecule-molecule interactions. The educational objectives are to promote electronic nanosensors related engineering education to undergraduate and graduate students, and to better prepare them as future innovators to transform nanobiotechnologies. The outreach objectives are to promote public awareness of the importance of nanosensors in health care and to attract the participation of K-12 students and underrepresented individuals in STEM careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is to fill the knowledge gap in nanopore sensing research by creating a significantly improved nanopore sensor platform that integrates low-optical background titanium oxide membranes on low-capacitance and hence low-electrical-noise sapphire. The research team will fabricate small and thin TiO2 membranes on sapphire, establish high-throughput manufacturing methods for both membrane formation and nanopore drilling, perform single-molecule DNA translocation, study the DNA-nanopore interaction, and analyze the data for methylation detection. The proposed sensor platform has a number of key features to support the development of a wide variety of emerging biomolecular diagnostic technologies. First, the creation of ultrasmall (&lt;10 Î¼m) dielectric membranes on insulating sapphire eliminates substrate conductance, and drastically minimizes the chip capacitance to a few picoFarads even for high-dielectric-constant and ultrathin (&lt;5 nm) TiO2 devices, thus significantly reducing the background high-frequency electrical noise and markedly improving high-bandwidth sensing. Further, both membrane formation and nanopore drilling will be achieved by high-throughput manufacturing methods, i.e. wafer-scale and batch-processing compatible sapphire etching and direct laser drilling, thus enabling low-cost and repeatable production. The scalably manufactured, low-noise, high-sensitivity nanopores will facilitate high-resolution gene identification and quantitation of their methylation status in a single measurement and at a greatly reduced cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

First, the team developed scalable manufacturing strategies to reproducibly create small and thin dielectric membranes on sapphire via anisotropic wet etching of sapphire. Specifically, two designs were successfully demonstrated to produce small (&lt;25 micrometer, or &micro;m) membranes over 2-inch wafers, using triangular and hexagonal shaped etching window designs, respectively. We discovered that controlled alignment of the triangular window patterns to the sapphire crystal at specific angles allowed engineering the facet evolution during sapphire etching to form micrometer-sized membranes, marking the first demonstration of wafer-scale fabrication of such membranes on sapphire. Further, we discovered that the use of hexagonal etching window design could tolerate even larger errors in such angle alignment to the sapphire crystal, thus enabling more reproducible fabrication of small-area membranes (&lt;30 &mu;m<sup>2</sup>) with almost 100% fabrication yield. This strategy allowed us to achieve a very small chip capacitance of smaller than 2 pico Farad, which is hundred times better than that from a conventional silicon chip and one of the lowest values reported so far.</p> <p>Further, the Wang lab explored different strategies to form thin membranes and small nanopores by e-beam radiation and controlled dielectric breakdown, and characterized the sapphire nanopore device noise. The sapphire-supported (SaS) nanopore chips demonstrated a ~5 times lower current noise amplitude (at 0.2 nanoamperes) than the conventional silicon device reported under the same high bandwidth (250 kilo hertz). Such low-noise SaS nanopore demonstrated high signal fidelity to distinguish the short (&lt;4 microseconds) and shallow events of DNA or protein signals from the background noise.</p> <p>This project demonstrates such sapphire based nanopore devices presents a manufacturable platform feasible for high-speed and low-noise sensing of a variety of biomolecules. The work paved the way for future use of our chips in detection complex molecular structures that will have broad impact on molecular marker detection and molecule-molecule interactions. The multi-disciplinary research also broadened participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impacted engineering education. For example, six Ph.D. graduate students (one female) were partly supported by this award. Among them, one student earned his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering from Arizona State University in fall 2022. In addition, three postdoctoral associates (two females) and one master&rsquo;s student were partly supported by this award. &nbsp;This award also contributed to successful recruitment and training of fourteen undergrad students (ten females, one veteran, one African American, and one with disability) by the Wang lab during the funding period. Those students and postdocs received training on sapphire chip manufacturing, microfabrication, biochemistry, single-molecule sensing, electronic systems, optics, and machine learning for data analysis. Our research supported by this award produced four articles published on prestigious journals, such as ACS Sensors, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces, and Biosensors and Bioelectronics, one manuscript currently under review, and 16 presentations at international conferences.</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 09/30/2024<br> Modified by: Chao&nbsp;Wang</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2020464/2020464_10667285_1727656129488_ACS_Fig34--rgov-214x142.gif" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2020464/2020464_10667285_1727656129488_ACS_Fig34--rgov-800width.gif" title="Wafer-scale fabrication of micrometer-sized membranes"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2020464/2020464_10667285_1727656129488_ACS_Fig34--rgov-66x44.gif" alt="Wafer-scale fabrication of micrometer-sized membranes"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(a) Sapphire facets in a cavity.
