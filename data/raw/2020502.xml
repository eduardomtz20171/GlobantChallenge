<AbstractNarration>This award supports the workshop “Collaborative Platforms for Engineering Biology: Biofoundries and Distributed Biorefineries”, that will convene experts across the US and internationally to address mechanisms to advance the global bioeconomies. Open, public biofoundries have recently emerged as key accelerators in engineering biology discovery and application, as well as unique spaces for training an emergent workforce and establishing a robust culture of safety and responsibility in engineering biology. Mobile biorefineries are emerging as a solution to the inefficiencies of biomass conversion, potentially allowing for reduced costs, more jobs, and increased renewable energy production. This workshop explores these tools for building a strong engineering biology research and development base – one that will contribute the technology, innovation, workforce, and infrastructure needed to secure a vibrant Bioeconomy. The workshop will share best practices and processes among global thought leaders in engineering biology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop promotes American engineering biology research and innovation that can drive economic growth across multiple sectors, while at the same time engaging our international partners on policies and paths forward that stimulate investment, data-sharing, testing, and collaboration in the fields that make up the bioeconomy. The workshop facilitates scientific and technological cooperation and capacity building through exchange of knowledge and human resources.  In addition, the UCSF Science Policy Group, comprised of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, have the opportunity to learn first-hand about collaborating nations work together to develop new, mutually advantageous avenues of economic growth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The project Workshop: Collaborative Platforms for Engineering Biology: Biofoundries and Distributed Biorefineries supported several opportunities for scientists and policy makers from around the world to meet and discuss emergent critically urgent issues.   As the funding arrived coincident with the COVID-19 pandemic, the initial gatherings moved to virtual formats. Those virtual meetings turned out to have unexpected benefits. At UCSF, the Science Policy student group was exposed to international science policy activities and discussions for the first time. This experience was invaluable in guiding career interests at a critical early stage. Another example of the reach of a virtual event: during the conference, participants from around the world used the chat function to ask questions and offer information during workshop sessions. One interesting discussion was initiated by Dr. Julius Ecuru, the head of BioInnovate Africa, about the prospects of implemented distributed biomanufacturing approaches in Africa. It is quite possible that these discussions and exchanges of ideas could only be possible in a virtual setting, with a low barrier to participation. In addition, capture of discussions via dynamic graphical representation provides a resource that could be shared as needed to guide future policy decisions.   Both the virtual events, and the in-person events supported by the award led to multiple ideas that address emergent issues such as climate change. One example under discussion was the development of lab-grown meat and its benefits in using and polluting less land and water and creating fewer greenhouse gas emissions. These technologies had not been under consideration in Europe until these discussions with US counterparts. An example of innovative collaboration initiated in Europe was the industrial symbiosis of taking waste from one process and directing it to another process in which it could be a feedstock. This idea from our European colleagues is simple in concept and would reduce waste; some efforts have recently been initiated in the US..   As with any good project, we did not know when we started what we might find or invent. The creativity unleashed by the series of virtual and in person events, joined by stakeholders from around the world was a delightful outcome. The collaborations created will continue to bear fruit into the future. As we work together to meet carbon and climate goals, a deeper awareness of technical, societal and political challenges preventing progress will help overcome barriers.
