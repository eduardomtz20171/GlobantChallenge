<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This grant will support research that will contribute new knowledge relates to the design and manufacture of next-generation flexible electronic devices. The work will advance fundamental understanding of process-structure-property relationships of a bi-continuous piezoelectric composite, an emerging flexible material with potentially high efficiency in converting mechanical energy into electrical signals. A bi-continuous piezoelectric composite is composed of a ceramic phase and a polymer phase, continuously interconnected in three dimensions (3D). Until now, bi-continuous piezoelectric composites can only be achieved in the form of an open-porosity ceramic structure impregnated by polymers, whose properties cannot be controlled accurately and reliably. By utilizing additive manufacturing methods, this research will provide new knowledge on how properties of a bi-continuous piezoelectric composite can be accurately tuned through careful control of its micro- and meso-structure via additive manufacturing. This new knowledge will enable the development of next-generation piezoelectric devices that are low cost and lightweight, with a wide range operating temperatures, high mechanical flexibility and advanced electromechanical performance. This award will also enhance the infrastructure for research and education in the states of Iowa and Mississippi through activities designed to attract students from underrepresented groups and K-12 students to STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research program is to uncover new fundamental knowledge for the design and manufacture of bi-continuous piezoelectric composites with controlled properties via additive manufacturing. The first research objective is to understand the fundamental mechanisms of porous microstructure formation in bi-continuous piezoelectric composites during additive manufacturing. To achieve this research objective, a phase-field-modeling method will be established to generate bi-continuous piezoelectric composite designs with 3D interconnected phase interfaces of desired connectivity. The second research objective is to quantify the effect of phase morphologies such as phase interfacial geometry on the piezoelectric properties of an additively manufactured bi-continuous piezoelectric composite with identified porous microstructures incorporated in the ceramic phase. To achieve this research objective, a two-scale computational model will be constructed to predict the piezoelectric properties of additively manufactured bi-continuous piezoelectric composites with predefined 3D phase interfaces. The computational model will be validated through characterizing piezoelectric properties of selected bi-continuous piezoelectric composite structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="default">This project aims to develop an integrated experimental-computational approach to understand the fundamental mechanism of porous microstructure formation in bi-continuous piezocomposites during the additive manufacturing (AM)-based fabrication process and to quantify the effect of both micro-porosity and phase morphologies on the piezoelectric properties. From the experimental side, a Suspension-Enclosing Projection-Stereolithography (SEPS) process has been developed to fabricate the ceramic phase followed by polymer infiltration. SEM has been used to characterize fabricated ceramic microstructure.

The obtained ferroelectric ceramic lattice structures require to be infiltrated with flexible polymers to form a bi-continuous piezocomposite (see Fig.1).</p> <p>The key outcome of the computational work from the University of Michigan-Dearborn team is a two-scale model consisting of ceramic grain scale and composite scale to systematically evaluate the effects of key microstructure features (e.g., micro-porosity) and various topologies of bi-continuous piezocomposites on their piezoelectric responses. At the ceramics level (Fig.2a), a Fourier Spectral Iterative Perturbation Method (FSIPM) is adopted to calculate the piezoelectric properties of the porous ceramics, which is an efficient and direct numerical algorithm for solving equilibrium equations in a periodic system. At the composite level (Fig.2b), finite-element method (FEM) is used to predict the piezoelectric properties of the polymer-ceramic composites with large deformation under different stimuli. We found all the bi-continuous piezocomposites outperform the traditional 3-3 piezocomposites with porous phase interface presented by Bowen, when the volume fraction of ceramic phase is greater than 20%. This is attributed to a larger stress transfer efficiency of triply periodic minimal interfaces than the traditional porous interface, as shown in Fig.3. With the same volume fraction of ceramics, particularly in the range of 25%-60%, BCC and FCC are superior to SC, which may be explained by their higher stress transfer efficiency (Fig.3). To evaluate the coupled effect of micro-porosity and topology on the hydrostatic responses of bi-continuous piezocomposites, the effective piezoelectric properties of piezoceramics with different VFs of micro-porosity are input into the composite scale. As can be observed in Fig.4, the hydrostatic figure of merit (HFOM) for all the three piezocomposites starts to increase dramatically once the ceramic phase is interpenetrated with each other, i.e., at connectivity equals to 0.1. In addition, the three piezocomposites become 3D interconnected at different values of geometrical design parameter u, i.e., distant VF of ceramics. In particular, the ceramic phase of BCC piezocomposite becomes 3D interconnected at a very low VF of ceramics (4.1%). The simulation results are compared with experimental measurements with good agreements as depicted by Fig. 5. The difference could be attributed to other effects not considered in the current model, such as interface effect between polymer and ceramic and/or grain orientation effect.</p> <p>For broader impacts, the proposed research will demonstrate the feasibility of tailoring the piezoelectric properties of a flexible piezoelectric composite via additive manufacturing.
