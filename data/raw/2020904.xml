<AbstractNarration>Local governments have traditionally been organized around function, with agencies and departments defined by the services they produce and deliver. Although organizational structures compartmentalized according to specific expertise can produce efficiencies, this fragmentation becomes problematic when governments attempt to address complex problems that transcend multiple units. Urban sustainability is an exemplar of issues which cut across numerous responsibilities traditionally held by distinct units within a single government organization. This research examines the relationship between municipal governments’ administrative arrangements, their policy adoption and implementation choices, and sustainability outcomes. It highlights the role of lead unit cross-functional authority—which we define as the clout that an initiative’s administrative lead has over other relevant units in the city government—and assesses its impact on local sustainability outcomes. In so doing, this research contributes to an evidence-based understanding of how public organizations function in order to enhance their design, management, and overall effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work advances convergence research drawing from organizational, policy, sustainable urban systems, and network science to increase the precision and robustness of the Functional Collective Action (FCA) framework. It provides important insight into the determinants of lead agency cross-functional authority—which extant research has highlighted as fundamental but inadequately operationalized—and its influence on policy outcome. Using urban sustainability as our policy lens, we employ a mixed-methods approach to collect and analyze data from focus groups of local government officials, public and private archival repositories, and a nationwide survey to: (a) develop a refined conceptualization and empirical measure of cross-functional authority that captures its various dimensions and mechanisms of influence; (b) develop a comprehensive national dataset of multiple sustainability outcome measures that are comparable across cities; and (c) create the first longitudinal database on local sustainability policies spanning a ten year period, which is often considered the minimum amount of time necessary for nuanced examination of policy implementation and policy change. The collection of data will enable improved testing of local institutional and governance theories and its analysis will facilitate advances in urban management and sustainability outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Local   governments have traditionally been organized around function, with agencies   and departments defined by the services they produce and deliver. This kind   of structural compartmentalization can challenge their ability to effectively   address complex problems that transcend multiple units and areas of   expertise. Urban sustainability is an exemplar of issues which cut across   numerous responsibilities traditionally held by distinct units within a   single government organization. Over the past two decades, local governments   have become involved in explicit efforts to increase sustainability. However,   not enough is known, at a generalizable level, about the extent to which city   actions actually impact local sustainability outcomes or how different   administrative practices might improve them. This research project collected   data on cities&rsquo; sustainability-relevant programs, policies, and management   practices, as well as on select outcome metrics that tap into   sustainability&rsquo;s three primary dimensions (i.e. environmental, economic, and   social). Together, this data allows examination of the relationship between   municipal governments&rsquo; administrative arrangements, their policy adoption and   implementation choices, and community-level sustainability outcomes. <ins datetime="2023-12-07T17:18" cite="mailto:Chris%20Hawkins"></ins></p> <p>Accurately measuring   changes, and drawing generalizable conclusions, requires having data for a   large number of cities at more than one point in time. Thus, one   element of this research involved conducting a national survey of U.S cities   in a manner that paralleled previous surveys administered to the same sample   of cities in 2010 and 2015 (591 U.S. cities completed the 2020 survey).   Together, these surveys provide data about cities&rsquo; sustainability priorities   and practices spanning ten years. <ins datetime="2023-12-07T17:18" cite="mailto:Chris%20Hawkins"></ins></p> <p>Next, using spatial data from a   variety of publicly available sources, the research team estimated city-level   values for several new variables associated with the release of fossil   fuel-based carbon emissions, tree canopy cover, and impervious surfaces (see   figure 1 for a depiction of the general estimation approach used). Data for   each of these variables was estimated in multiple years, enabling examination   of change over time within and across cities. These layers of data can   further be combined with layers containing information about community   demographics, enabling observations of, for example, changes in tree canopy   cover in reference to populations with different income characteristics.&nbsp; <ins datetime="2023-12-07T17:18" cite="mailto:Chris%20Hawkins"></ins></p> <p>Understanding  the relationship between city government actions and sustainability outcomes  was a driving objective of the research. Within this scope, our analysis focused on organizational structure and  capacity, particularly the characteristics of the government unit or staff  that are responsible for their community&rsquo;s sustainability initiatives. Analysis  of the data collected through this project indicate the use of four broad  types of strategies by the lead sustainability unit to facilitate  collaboration and functional integration within city government: legitimating,  rational persuasion, upward appeal, and consultation (see Figure 2). Moreover,  we find evidence suggesting that  actions city governments take to increase their own organizational capacity  can result in improvements to community sustainability. Specifically, we find  that cities&rsquo; completion of a GHG emissions inventory leads to a modest but  statistically significant reduction in onsite residential emissions. Although  the presence of an emissions inventory does not have direct impact on  emissions, it appears to have a substantial <em>indirect</em> impact as a result of increasing the knowledge a city  government has about the local emissions profile and options for mitigation.  The information it provides appears to at least somewhat supplant the  anecdotal logic, satisficing, and political calculations that may otherwise  drive local decision-making, resulting in modestly more sustainable local  outcomes (see Figure 3).&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 12/15/2023<br> Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;V&nbsp;Hawkins</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2020904/2020904_10705834_1702668971615_image_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2020904/2020904_10705834_1702668971615_image_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="image 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2020904/2020904_10705834_1702668971615_image_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="image 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Revised taxonomy of intra-organizational influence tactics utilized by sustainability leads in U.S cities</div> <div class="imageCredit">research team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;V&nbsp;Hawkins <div class="imageTitle">image 2</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2020904/2020904_10705834_1702668928499_figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2020904/2020904_10705834_1702668928499_figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Image 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2020904/2020904_10705834_1702668928499_figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Image 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">general approach to estimation of city level outcome data</div> <div class="imageCredit">adopted from Vulcan.com</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;V&nbsp;Hawkins <div class="imageTitle">Image 1</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2020904/2020904_10705834_1702669004138_image_3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2020904/2020904_10705834_1702669004138_image_3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="image 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/2020904/2020904_10705834_1702669004138_image_3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="image 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Example conceptually connecting local planning and administrative decisions to sustainability outcomes</div> <div class="imageCredit">research team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;V&nbsp;Hawkins <div class="imageTitle">image 3</div> </div> </li></ul> </div> </div></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
