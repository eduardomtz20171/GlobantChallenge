<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by improving how cybersecurity concepts are taught in undergraduate computing curricula. The need to design and maintain cyber-secure computing systems is increasingly important. As a result, the future technology workforce must be trained to have a security mindset, so that they consider cybersecurity during rather than after system design.  This project aims to achieve this goal by building plug-and-play, hands-on cybersecurity modules for core courses in Computer Engineering, and Computer Science and Engineering. The modules will align with the curricula recommended by the Association for Computing Machinery and will be designed for easy adoption into computing programs nationwide. Modules will be designed for integration into both introductory and advanced courses, thus helping students develop in-depth understanding of cybersecurity as they progress through their computing curriculum.  It is expected that the project will encourage more students to pursue careers or higher degrees in the field of cybersecurity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will examine how the modules may be best integrated into existing curricula and the effects of the modules on student learning and interest in cybersecurity. Assessment will leverage several methods including (a) a task load index to quantify rigor, (b) surveys to gain insight into the development of students' security mindset and perceptions of cybersecurity, and (c) analysis of learning using analytical course rubrics. Deliverables of this project will include a suite of plug-and-play cybersecurity modules for Computer Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering courses that span from introductory to advanced levels and that meet standards for content breadth and depth. The results will be disseminated through publications, presentations, press releases, and social media to ensure that project outcomes are shared widely. The NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Education and Human Resources Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Overview   CyberMUG was a joint initiative between Purdue University Northwest (PNW) and the University of Toledo (UToledo), along with Michigan Technological University (MTU) and Fairfield University (FU). The project was driven by the critical role of cybersecurity across all engineering fields and the challenge many higher education institutions face in establishing standalone cybersecurity programs. Its goal was to instill a security mindset in undergraduate students majoring in computer engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, and related fields, encouraging them to pursue careers in cybersecurity and prepare for future cyber threats. The integration of modules into various courses at different levels aimed to reinforce this cybersecurity mindset among students.   Project Goal   The CyberMUG initiative aims to create plug-and-play cybersecurity modules for computer science and computer engineering courses from freshman to senior levels. These modules will be used to assess student understanding of security concepts across various domains. The initiative has three main goals: introducing secure design practices early to reduce vulnerabilities, fostering a security mindset among undergraduates to emphasize the importance of cybersecurity in all computational activities, and encouraging interest in cybersecurity careers to address the national skills shortage. To accomplish these objectives, CyberMUG identified the following objectives:     Develop cybersecurity plug-and-play modules aligned with different courses in computer science & engineering and electrical engineering curricula.     Evaluate, assess, and analyze developed cybersecurity modules through an external evaluator.     Disseminate the project outcomes in conferences/journals.     Release the developed modules online through a dedicated website.     Broader Impacts   CyberMUG will have broader impacts in terms of enabling training of a cybersecurity-aware workforce that prioritizes security during system design and development rather than addressing it as an afterthought. At multiple institutions, including Purdue University Northwest (PNW), the University of Toledo (UToledo), Fairfield University (FU), and Michigan Technological University (MTU), both undergraduate and graduate students were involved in creating modules that are compatible with computer engineering or computer science programs. These modules were tested and refined over the projects four-year duration and made available on a website for widespread use. The projects findings were shared through conferences, and online platforms, with instructional manuals provided for free distribution to enhance cybersecurity education across various institutions.   Project Outcomes   CyberMUG resulted in the following outcomes.     Mentoring of graduate and undergraduate research assistants in presentation and pedagogical techniques.     Training and development of faculty members involved in the project.     Developed modules were found to positively affect cybersecurity learning and perception of the students.     Development of modules for the following course:     C++ Programming (Freshman/sophomore year)     Java Programming (Freshman/sophomore year)     Discrete Structures (Sophomore Year)     Operating Systems (Junior Year)     Software Engineering (Junior Year)     Embedded Systems (Junior Year)     Computer Organization and Digital System Design (Junior/Sophomore year)     Computer Networks (Senior Year)     Machine Learning (Senior Year)     Communication Systems (Senior Year)      Modules for six courses have been tested and are positively affirming the proposed hypothesis of enhancing student understanding of impact and role of cybersecurity in those individual courses (discrete structures, C++ programming, Java programming, computer networks, machine learning, and embedded systems).     A website for disseminating information about the project and to make modules available to both professional developers and high school teachers (https://sites.google.com/pnw.edu/nsfcybermug).     At the end of the project, results of the following evaluation questions (or RQs) were affirmative:     Do students better understand the role of cybersecurity in individual CE/CSE courses through these modules?     Does the integration of cybersecurity modules increase students interest in pursuing cybersecurity as a career?        Last Modified: 10/25/2024       Submitted by: AhmadYJavaid]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
