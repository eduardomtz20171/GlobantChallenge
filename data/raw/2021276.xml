<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by increasing retention and academic achievement of rural or first-generation college students in STEM fields. To this end, Morningside College will develop and test a two-year pathway of four general education courses designed to serve undergraduate biology and/or chemistry majors. These general education courses will integrate project- and place-based STEM research experiences that are relevant to the local community.  Potential research themes include water quality and availability, prairie restoration, and food safety.  The courses and research experiences will be designed to meet general education requirements for developing skills in critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, communication, and ethical analysis.  They will also support the students’ development of scientific reasoning skills.  The STEM research/general education pathway is expected to support greater success of rural and first-generation STEM students.  The project will examine this hypothesis by comparing learning outcomes of students in the STEM research/general education pathway relative to students in the traditional pathway of separate general education and introductory STEM courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop, implement, and evaluate an innovative two-year general education curriculum aimed at increasing representation of rural or first-generation students in the STEM workforce pipeline. The project will measure the effectiveness of this pathway through results from targeted surveys and reasoning skills assessments.  Specifically, the project will: 1) determine how a two-year pathway of general education courses that integrate project- and place-based STEM research affects retention of rural or first-generation students; 2) assess student progress toward learning STEM skills, such as scientific reasoning; and 3) determine the impact of the four-course pathway on student agency and motivation to persist in STEM. The project will add to the evidence base regarding effective support for rural or first-generation STEM students. The project will integrate intensive faculty development to augment faculty members’ teaching skills and help define key factors or issues needed to scale this work across STEM fields of study and to other predominantly undergraduate institutions serving rural students.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>From January 2021-December 2023, Morningside University implemented a program called PERSIST:&nbsp;Integrating Project- and Place-based Research Experiences into General Education Courses to Increase Persistence of First-generation and Rural Undergraduates in STEM. This program was designed to implement a sequence of courses for incoming Biology/Chemistry majors that were first-generation colleges students and/or from a rural background, centered around Project-Based Learning (PBL) during the first two years of college. The three-semester PBL course sequence began in the Spring semester of the students' freshman year, and continued through both semesters of their sophomore year. PBL is method of learning in which students are much more free to establish and explore their own questions, investigations, and learning; this is a much more open-ended approach to traditional lecture-based courses, and is designed so that&nbsp;<span>students learn by actively engaging in real-world and personally meaningful projects</span><span>. In the context of STEM student learning, our program encouraged this by having student groups design their own research questions and investigations. This is not something that STEM students typically do at this point in their college careers, and our hope was that by doing so, benefits including but not limited to the following would be observed:</span></p> <p><span>1) Students would learn how to employ the process of scientific investigation without the fear of making mistakes (as making mistakes is an important part of the process for scientists in the "real world).</span></p> <p><span>2) Students would develop positive attitudes and identifications with regard to science. In particular, by having the students have such ownership over their projects, we hoped that would translate to a higher level of agency, help them to see themselves as "real scientists" that had the ability to succeed in science, and develop confidence in their ability to think through complex scientific problems.</span></p> <p><span>3) Students would demonstrate accelerated development of their thought-processes in solving complex scientific problems, manifesting in more highly-developed research skills as well as better preparing them to handle more rigorous courses they would encounter in Biology and Chemistry.</span></p> <p><span>Upon completion of this project, the grant team has observed several important outcomes:</span></p> <p><span>1) When compared to a control group of incoming Biology/Chemistry students, the PERSIST students demonstrated a notably higher level of retention from the first-to-second year (86% vs 71%).</span></p> <p><span>2) PERSIST students demontrated a higher level of academic performance (GPA) in their Biology/Chemistry courses than the control group.

This indicates a higher level of preparation and confidence in the PERSIST students, enabling them to earlier engage more challengeing Biology/Chemistry courses.</span></p> <p><span>4) PERSIST students demonstrated considerably higher levels of self-efficacy, agency, and scientific identity than the control after the initial semester of PERSIST. These differences flattened by the end of the PERSIST program, though PERSIST students still demonstrated a higher level of scientific identity.

We hypothesize that this is due to the following factors: a) by this time student load and stress levels had increased due to them performing their research and taking more difficult classes than they initially did, and b) students by this point had been working on the same project with the same team members for three semesters, and were ready to move on to something else/new.
