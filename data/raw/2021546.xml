<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by laying the foundation for increased access to research experiences at community colleges. Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) enable students to do original research as part of their regular coursework.  CUREs have the potential to advance equity goals by providing research experiences for all students, not just a select few. In addition, because two-year colleges have high enrollments of students from underrepresented groups, making CURES widely available has the potential to increase diversity in the STEM workforce.  A group of faculty members at Whatcom Community College have been implementing CUREs in different STEM disciplines, including biology, geology, and engineering.  An increasing number of other faculty are interested in implementing CUREs in their classes.  The proposed project would leverage this interest to examine how the institution can widen the use of CUREs and, thus, generate an institutional transformation in STEM instructional practices. The two-year project will also contribute to national interests by completing a study on institutional change at a two-year college, which can inform the efforts of other institutions to improve STEM teaching and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to: (1) identify Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) for institutional capacity for CURE expansion and institutionalization; (2) support current CURE adopters through community building and feedback; (3) revisit the SWOT analysis to determine the institutional capacity to reform curricular efforts; and (4) disseminate key findings. The SWOT analysis will be part of a multi-day strategic planning retreat with CURE-implementing faculty and administrators. Participating CURE faculty members will develop a learning community to guide and support the process of developing CUREs. Considering the COVID-19 Pandemic, the project will have a focus on designing CURE experiences for online learning. The project will include a series of faculty interviews to provide rich descriptions of the mechanisms and reasons for implementing CUREs. Using these data, along with collaboration with an expert on institutional change, this project has the potential to produce a model of institutional improvement that is grounded in the experiences of faculty members at two-year colleges for which there is limited research. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.  Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

As we prepared to bring together a community of interested faculty into a learning community, we entered into the pandemic, resulting in a pivot for both the grant and the faculty involved. With our faculty learning community (FLC), we started to meet by Zoom two times a quarter. These hour-long Zoom meetings provided a chance to build community, check in with each other and talk about CUREs. Initially, most faculty were brand new to CUREs but interested in a new approach to teaching. In our first year, we worked to come to common language and understandings (e.g., developing a working definition of a CURE) and identified where people were with their own thinking and goals for themselves.

Many faculty talked about how important this time together was to both help them through the pandemic, as well as build and develop their craft of teaching CUREs. Because of the grant, we were able to compensate all faculty for their time participating in the community- which allowed for more adjunct faculty to be able to participate.

In addition, with continuous turnover in administration during the time of the grant, there was an ongoing need to educate new administrators about the culture of CUREs at Whatcom.
