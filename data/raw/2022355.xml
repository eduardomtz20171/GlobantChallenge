<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 55-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum.  The Belmont Forum is a consortium of research funding organizations focused on support for transdisciplinary approaches to global environmental change challenges and opportunities.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in this Collaborative Research Action, the partner agencies have provided support to foster global transdisciplinary research teams to address critical issues in ocean sustainability including, conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.  This complex challenge required that the projects utilized integrated, transdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches and bring together natural and social sciences as well as policymakers, resource managers, industries, citizens and other societal partners.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries to increase our knowledge of the complex linkages and pathways needed to accelerate sustainable use of oceans and minimize the effects from global change.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MULTI-FRAME will focus on evaluating pathways toward a sustainable and equitable use of oceans by assessing the potential impact of ocean multi-use in real world challenges.  The multi-use concept refers to intentional joint use of ocean space and resources by two or more users in close geographic proximity. It represents inclusive sharing of resources by one or more users which can contribute to a more sustainable use of ocean resources by reducing spatial pressures, creating new opportunities for socio-economic developments and providing environmental benefits.  The project brings together a transdisciplinary, international research consortium with expertise ocean planning, ecology, stakeholder engagement, value chain and sustainability analysis, conservation and decision analysis.  The team of academics, non-governmental and private sector researchers will work together to provide a critical analysis of ocean multi-use, in 5 different geographic locations, to identify potential pathways to promote simultaneous use of ocean areas by services that may have conflicting interests.  MULTI-FRAME will benefit a broad range of local and national-level stakeholders, including local communities, government, marine planning agencies, and local and national decision-makers by increasing the knowledge base of sustainable ocean multi-use practices to help improve and foster the blue (ocean) economy while preserving ocean space and resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  MULTI-FRAME was an internationally collaborative project focused on ocean multi-use (MU) which is defined as the intentional joint use of marine space and resources by two or more users in close geographic proximity (image attached highlights MU opportunities). MU represents a radical change from exclusive space or resource rights to deliberate sharing of resources by one or more uses. The concept is gaining popularity as an approach that can contribute to more sustainable use of ocean resources and is advocated by European Union policy and research programs. Ocean MU can reduce spatial pressures, create new opportunities for socio-economic developments and have environmental benefits, but currently there is not much knowledge available on its potential in the U.S. and possible impacts from implementation. Existing approaches for managing marine space and assessing impacts are still largely focused on single-use planning. A brief project video explaining MU for a public audience is available on YouTube: https://youtu.be/LZnISbMRJyo. MULTI-FRAME was a transdisciplinary Belmont Forum project that began in August 2020 and ended in July 2024, and was a multi-national partnership with collaborators in seven countries, specifically Germany (lead), Norway, Sweden, France, Brazil, Mozambique and the United States. The project involved extensive international cooperation, knowledge sharing and learning over a 5-year period (including a 1-year no-cost extension). At the project outset, COVID caused some delays requiring the team to interact only virtually. Eventually face-to-face team meetings were held in Berlin (Germany, November 2021), Florianopolis (Brazil, October 2022) and Kristineberg (Sweden, April 2023) for direct exchange and discussion. Additionally, U.S. and foreign partners participated in several international conferences and other events to share the research efforts.    All countries involved in the project (except Germany) focused a specific MU case study in their nation. The U.S. team investigated and raised awareness for the potential of ocean MU in southern New England with an emphasis on fisheries and offshore wind. American efforts were funded by the National Science Foundation and led by the University of Rhode Island (URI), specifically Jen McCann from the URI Coastal Resources Center and J.P. Walsh, a Professor in the URI Graduate School of Oceanography and involved other staff and students from URI as well as two NSF-funded Global Sustainability Scholars. Prior to external engagement, the U.S. team contributed to the process of better defining MU and created a series of Blueprint examples. Also, URI led the development of the MU Assessment Approach, which outlined the methodology for project case studies and serves as a guide for future efforts exploring MU potential. In southern New England, the U.S. team shared the MU concept through several meetings with relevant stakeholders, including commercial and recreational fishers, offshore wind professionals, coastal business owners, government representatives and others. Additionally, the project conducted related social science research including semi-structured interviews of key informants from the fishing, offshore wind and government sectors. This body of work revealed some openness to the MU concept and its opportunities, and potential benefits (e.g., fish population increases, tourism) were noted from the Block Island Wind Farm, a recent example of MU in southern New England. However, significant barriers to advancing MU in the region were highlighted. More specifically, representatives from commercial fishing expressed unease about safety due to the spacing of turbines, and many participants voiced concern over the lack of a process and policy for implementation and the absence of clear support from the government (state or federal). Ultimately, the project helped build strong local and global networks and proved to be successful in advancing understanding, encouraging related research and growing interest in exploring opportunities into the future. Additional project deliverables included the Policy Brief, Transferability Report and the final Ocean Multi-Use Toolkit. More information on MULTI-FRAME and access to all of the Belmont Forum deliverables can be found on the project website: https://submariner-network.eu/multi-frame/. The project has a few peer-reviewed publications today (linked below), and two additional manuscripts focused on (1) the U.S. case study described above and (2) the Brazil case study are in preparation.
