<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 55-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum.  The Belmont Forum is a consortium of research funding organizations focused on support for transdisciplinary approaches to global environmental change challenges and opportunities.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders. This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on coral reefs â€“ one of the most valuable ecosystems on the planet that are being lost at an alarming rate.  This loss threatens human lives because coral reefs provide food, income, and shoreline protection. Efforts are underway worldwide to rehabilitate reefs, with mixed success.  This project uses a novel approach to rebuild coral reef ecosystems by building artificial reefs and seeding them with biota from healthy coral reefs.  The project will be carried out in Ranobe Bay in southwest Madagascar which contains 32 kilometers of coastline with 13 villages, increasing populations, and growing rates of malnutrition largely caused by overfishing.  The primary goal is to rebuild healthy coral reef ecosystems and increase fisheries catch in Madagascar to reduce the incidence of malnutrition in the most impoverished country in the world.  All aspects of the project will involve local scientists and fishers. The project will utilize cutting edge tools, including environmental DNA barcoding, fisher supported GPS tracking of fisheries activities, and extensive human health and well-being data collection to comprehensively connect ecosystem health to human health.  This project will provide a comprehensive blueprint for other coral reef restoration projects by thoroughly testing a new technology, creating tools to measure success, providing a guide describing the ecosystem to human health data collection protocols. Overall, this project will greatly enhance the equitable and sustainable use of marine resources and will respond to a threat caused by global change, all with a tool that can be applied anywhere coral reef ecosystems are found.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Coral reefs are vital ecosystems that are disappearing rapidly due to climate change and local human activities. This loss of biodiversity and habitat complexity results in ecosystems that provide decreasing amounts of seafood for local consumption, endangering food security, incomes, and coastal protection for millions of people. We implemented a new reef restoration approach in Southwestern Madagascar to enhance fisheries and combat malnutrition in one of the world's poorest and most malnourished countries.&nbsp;</p> <p>Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) are small structures consisting of stacked PVC plates that mimic reef habitat to passively attract a diversity of reef species. Originally devised to census reef biodiversity, we used ARMS to collect and transfer the biodiversity necessary to &ldquo;seed&rdquo; new reefs. Our team created an accessible ARMS design, transitioning materials from PVC and stainless steel to limestone. We deployed nearly 200 ARMS in the Bay of Ranobe, our research site, engaging approximately 600 community members in the restoration process. We are building six 1-ha artificial reefs and seeding half with ARMS colonized on the healthiest reef in the Bay. This ecosystem-scale experiment is allowing us to comprehensively test the efficacy of ARMS seeding by tracking biodiversity from microorganisms to large predators, quantifying fish catch and effort, and using a prospective cohort study to evaluate human well-being.</p> <p>We found that microbes and algae were highly correlated on the seafloor, indicating that overfishing is harming reef communities. Reef depth predicted hard coral cover, demonstrating that local fishing pressures are particularly acute on shallow reefs. Nearly 200 fish species were caught in the Bay and the average catch was less than 10 cm long. The small size of harvested fish was not solely because all large fish had already been caught, as is common. Larger fish were caught less often because the most common gear types target smaller fish, gear types which also produce the largest amount of catch per unit effort. Aquaculture is frequently heralded as an alternative livelihood to fishing. In this region, aquaculture is instead an additional livelihood, and not a full time occupation. 91% of people in the region live in poverty compared to the national average of 77%, while childhood stunting was three times higher in inland farming villages relative to coastal fishing villages, highlighting micro-variation in nutrition and the broader challenges of food security in the region.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p> <p>The use of ARMS to census reef biodiversity is increasing. We developed an alternative to destructive sampling that leaves ARMS undisturbed by carrying out a standardized visual census underwater, generating multiple benefits from this tool.</p> <p>Our team designed innovative mixed-methods approaches to assess the intersection of climate and environmental change, coral reef and fisheries conditions, fisher catch and seafood market dynamics, and human dietary intake, nutritional status, and mental health. The model for this research can be used elsewhere to explore the food system and human health implications of environmental change.&nbsp;</p> <p>This study represents a unique example of integration across the social-ecological spectrum. That is, we demonstrate the importance of working with communities to characterize not only the dimensions of environmental factors that shape the sustainability of reef ecosystems but also the social factors that determine how community members interact with this environment.&nbsp;</p> <p>Our team developed culturally adapted mental health assessment tools for Madagascar in the Malagasy language and we tested them for assessing depression and anxiety symptoms, providing the first validated tools for these issues in Madagascar. This is the first study to empirically evaluate the association between environmental and climate stressors and mental health in fishing communities.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p> <p>Through education, we have trained over 100 Malagasy undergraduate and graduate students, integrating local knowledge and participation into our research. Approximately 75 undergraduate and MS students took our reef ecology course (lecture and field) and our data science bootcamps. A large number of early-career Malagasy scientists gained hands-on research and scientific training, including one PhD student and five MS students in reef ecology, two PhD students, five MS students, and five technicians in fisheries ecology, and two PhD students and six technicians in human health. The team included 13 others early career scientists, ranging from MS students to postdocs, and originating from seven nationalities. Consortium members were 52% women and 81% are from low and middle-income countries.&nbsp;</p> <p>The ARMS and the artificial reefs were translated into design principles for locally adapted reef restoration technologies by local Malagasy scientists. These technologies are being implemented for the first time via this project. ARMS seeding has potential applications in more than 100 countries with coral reefs. If the technology and community engagement can scale, this work can serve as a model for reef habitat restoration as a core intervention in protecting human livelihoods, nutrition, and mental health.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 10/25/2024<br> Modified by: Aaron&nbsp;C&nbsp;Hartmann</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div
