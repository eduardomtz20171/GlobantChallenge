<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The relationship between species diversity (i.e., the number of species) of an ecological community and its productivity (e.g., the amount of biomass produced in a year) has been studied intensively in ecology, both from a theoretical point of view, and through some of the largest experiments ever conducted in the field. Understanding how biodiversity and productivity are related is essential for applications, such as the development of biofuels, as well as to predict the effects of species loss. The project aims to leverage the large amount of experimental data available to develop new statistical, mathematical and computational tools that can be used to predict the productivity of untested ecological communities, and to determine the contribution of shared evolutionary history to the functioning of ecosystems. Importantly, the same mathematical machinery developed for the study of ecological communities can be used to answer distant questions, such as the effect of combinations of antibiotics on the growth of bacteria. The work is complemented by the publication of software packages, lecture notes and teaching material, to facilitate community adoption and extension of the newly developed tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to develop a statistical framework to fit data stemming from Biodiversity-Ecosystem Functioning experiments that is consistent with the Generalized Lotka-Volterra model, one of the best-studied models for population dynamics. To keep the number of free parameters sufficiently small, interactions between any two species are modeled as a function of their shared evolutionary history. In turn, this makes it possible to test the effects of phylogeny on productivity, by including the whole structure of the evolutionary tree connecting all members of an ecological community, rather than summary statistics as in current practice. By moving beyond the linear regression approaches traditionally used to model these data, the project will bridge the gap between theory of population dynamics and experimental approaches. To further connect population dynamics with phylogenetic information, the project will develop models with explicit accounting for phylogeny, allowing research to investigate the effects of shared evolutionary history on the coexistence and stability of ecological communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  With the work of Darwin, shared evolutionary history became one of the main organizing principles in biology. Similar species are expected to share resources, pathogen and life histories; because of this, it is expected that related species would compete more strongly than unrelated species. Darwin wrote: "As species of the same genus have usually, though by no means invariably, some similarity in habits and constitution, and always in structure, the struggle will generally be more severe between species of the same genus, when they come into competition with each other, than between species of distinct genera." (On the Origin of Species, 1859).   How to include shared phylogenetic history in models for ecological dynamics has been a challenge: different modeling approaches have accounted for different aspects of phylogeny, including measures of shared ancestry ("phylogenetic diversity") and phylogenetic-informed regression.   The goal of the project was to develop a statistical framework in which phylogenetic trees could be integrated easily and effectively. The framework was then applied to data stemming from large-scale experiments in which plant species are grown in different combinations. The newly-developed framework presents several advantages over previous attempts: a) it makes use of data recorded at the level of each population, rather than aggregating all the populations grown in a given experimental plot; b) it accounts for the full phylogenetic tree, rather than measuring statistics on the tree; c) it is flexible, and can be used in conjunction with popular methods to fit statistical models, including Ordinary Least Squared, Weighted Least Squares, likelihood maximization, and Bayesian approaches.   Results show that indeed, as postulated by Darwin, related species experience elevated competition. Moreover, the approach allows to identify which specific branches of the phylogenetic tree have the stronger effects. By fitting models using the "true" phylogenetic tree vs. randomized trees, one can compute a p-value, expressing the probability that the experimental data could be better explained when ignoring phylogenetic relatedness. Again, results show that information on shared ancestry provides important information to determine the strength of competition between species.   Besides the development of a statistical framework to integrate phylogenetic relatedness in models for experimental data, the project also advanced knowledge on the theory of population dynamics when phylogeny determines the strength of interaction between the species.   The framework can be extended to account for other drivers of ecological interactions, such as shared traits, functional groups, and other ways to organize species relatedness in a hierarchical fashion.
