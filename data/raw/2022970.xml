<AbstractNarration>Viral contamination of drinking water can cause disease. Although such waterborne diseases pose significant public health threats, current filtration technologies suitable for virus removal have high cost and energy requirements.  This prevents their widespread use and has led to the need for less expensive and sustainable alternatives for disinfecting drinking water. The goal of this project is to use computational biology tools to discover plant-based  peptides that can trap viruses to create low-cost and energy-efficient drinking water filters. The potential for scale up will be assessed to understand the impacts of common water constituents on virus-protein interactions to improve sustainable and effective filter operation. Creation of a large database of plant peptides will be broadly informative to other scientific disciplines and easily accessible via internet resource to be developed as part of this project. Successful development of plant-based water biofilters will have a range of potential applications including the replacement of aging infrastructure and use in disaster relief situations. More broadly, low cost filters have significant potential to decrease waterborne disease deaths worldwide through improved access to clean drinking water. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water contamination with human enteric viruses is one of the leading causes of acute diarrhea hospitalization and fatalities worldwide. Removal of these viruses can be achieved through filtration and other water treatment technologies. Although filtration has been one of the most widely used techniques for drinking water treatment, there has been comparatively little innovation in filtration in recent decades. The goal of this project is to develop sustainable, scalable filters functionalized with sustainable plant material known as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Specific objectives designed to achieve the project goal focus on understanding the fundamental biomolecular and physicochemical interactions to: 1) Computationally identify plant-derived AMPs that preferentially bind viral capsid proteins for use in plant-based pathogen filters; 2) Validate chosen AMPs using lab removal tests with the enteric viruses Adenovirus 2, Rotavirus OSU strain, and Tulane virus (a surrogate for human norovirus); 3) Identify readily available substrates and feasible filter configurations that can be tailored to a range of applications; and 4) Quantify interactions and interferences between filter surfaces, viruses, and water matrix components to enable translation to the field scale. Successful completion of these research objectives will lead to the development of a data-driven framework for creating and evaluating AMP-based materials. Further, low cost-effective plant-based pathogen filters have the potential to reduce waterborne disease worldwide through widespread adoption of the technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The purpose of this grant was to design energy efficient and effective filters using plant antimicrobial peptides for the removal of contaminants from water. An example of this are the cationic proteins found in the seeds of the Moringa oleifera (moringa) tree. These peptides can easily be used as a coating on fibers to create a filter that has previously been shown to remove high levels of viruses and bacteria.   Part of the goal of this project is to test these filters under realistic conditions. Specifically, our part of the project was to Study the interactions between the water matrix and the filter substrate to identify key challenges for scale-up and explore strategies to overcome the challenges. One major challenge for the implementation of this filter is the presence of organic matter in most natural waters. This organic matter adsorbs onto the moringa coating, blocking the sites required for the removal of other contaminants.   Our team had two approaches to remediate this challenge. The first was to quantify the amount of organic matter that would adsorb to the moringa-coated fibers. We used humic acid as a surrogate for organic matter found in water. We were able to model the adsorption of humic acid based on a Langmuirian isotherm under various conditions. This allows engineers to overdesign the filter to allow for the adsorption of the organic matter and the contaminants.   The second approach is to create a pre-filter using biochar made from waste material. For this work, we chose biochar made from cotton gin waste as well as walnut shells. We showed the all the humic acid is removed using the biochar from cotton gin waste but only 10 - 40% of the humic acid is removed using biochar from walnut shells. This is important as it helps to guide the design of a pre-filter to protect the moringa-coated filter and allow it to remove the contaminants it was designed to remove.   In addition to the removal of organic matter, we also explored the use of moringa-coated fibers for the removal of dye molecules using Red Dye 40. We found that the use of moringa augmented the removal of the dye due to the cationic nature of the surface but also allowed the dye to be re-captured with simply rinsing techniques.      Our work on this grant contributes to use of these filters under realistic conditions by suggesting a few ways to remove the organic matter present. It also introduces the idea of using these filters to remove dyes.         Last Modified: 12/19/2023       Submitted by: StephanieBVelegol]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
