<AbstractNarration>The minerals that comprise Earth’s crust and mantle undergo phase transformations. Changes in their crystal structure occur in response to changes in temperature and pressure. With increasing pressure, olivine — the main constituent of the upper mantle  — transforms into denser minerals; much like graphite transforms into diamond. As one mineral transforms into another, crystal defects, known as dislocations, are produced. Dislocations allow crystals to deform plastically, i.e., permanently.  These dislocations can cause temporary weakening that speeds up crust and mantle flows. Transformation-induced weakening  — "transformation plasticity"  —  may impact the mantle flows driving plate tectonics. It may also provide an explanation for the earthquakes occurring at great depths in the mantle.  These deep earthquakes are still poorly understood. Despite its importance, transformation plasticity has seldom been observed in the laboratory. This is because it involves complex processes, difficult to quantify by conventional methods. Here, The researchers  conduct experiments at the extreme pressures and temperature prevailing in the mantle.  They study the plasticity of fayalite, olivine Fe-rich end member, and quartz which is an important constituent of the continental crust. They use a state-of-the-art high-pressure deformation device set up at a national synchrotron facility.  There, powerful X-rays allow imaging the minerals and analyzing their properties during their transformations.  The multidisciplinary project, at the intersection of geophysics, materials science, and crystallography, aims to expand the understanding of Earth’s interior dynamics. It supports the professional development of an early career scientist. It also provides training for one graduate and several undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Transformation plasticity may play a central role in: 1) mantle decoupling and the development of layered convection; 2) slab ponding in Earth’s mantle transition zone; 3) shear zone nucleation during orogenesis; 4) mantle plume upwelling; and 5) the nucleation of deep-focus earthquakes. However, few studies have examined transformation plasticity in major rock-forming minerals. This is because of the difficulty to quantify complex transient behaviors at high temperatures (&gt;1000 K) and pressures (&gt; 1 GPa). Here, the team explores the quartz-coesite and olivine-spinel phase transformations  — under hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic conditions  — using a Deformation-DIA (D-DIA) apparatus located at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory. This experimental setup is uniquely suited to examining transformation-related phenomena in situ at mantle pressures and temperatures. Stresses and transformation kinetics are quantified via energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction. Axial and volume strains are measured using X-ray radiography. Constitutive laws describing transformation plasticity are derived, benchmarked against experimental data, and extrapolated to Earth conditions. Run product microstructures are also investigated in detail — using high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction — to interrogate the physical processes responsible for transformation-induced weakening. Ultimately, the team seeks to determine the importance of transformation plasticity in Earth’s crust and mantle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The overall goal of this project was to understand changes in the flow behavior of the Earths lithosphere and mantle due to mineral phase transformations.As temperatures and pressures increase with depth in the earths interior, minerals like olivine become thermodynamically unstable and change, or transform, to more stable structures.During such phase transformations, there is typically a decrease in the volume of the mineral after the transformation as the atoms within the crystal structure of the mineral take on a more densely packed arrangement.Because not all the crystals in the rocks transform at the same time, the volume change that occurs with the phase transformation results in a geometric mismatch, causing a local increase in the stress.As the stress (the push on the rocks that causes them to deform) increases in this way, the rock deforms more quickly.In this manner, phase transformations at depth in the earth can cause an enhanced rate or flow that can affect various large-scale geophysical processes, like the subduction of tectonic plates at convergent plate boundaries  i.e., subduction zones.Phase transformations can cause rocks in Earths interior to deform orders of magnitude faster than they would in the absence of phase transformation.This phenomenon, called transformation plasticity (TP), produces a mechanical instability linked to the decoupling of convective motion in the earth; deflection of subducted plates (slabs) and mantle plumes, so-called deep-focus earthquakes, and localization of deformation during burial and exhumation of rocks by tectonic processes.Although TP was first recognized in classic experiments on iron bars almost a century ago, its occurrence in rocks and minerals remains poorly understood. While several theories have been developed to explain TP, there are few experimental observations of TP in minerals, with most of our current knowledge derived from benchtop experiments on analogue materials for rocks.   In this project, we explored TP using X-ray technology. We performed experiments using an apparatus that can apply very high pressures and temperatures on real rock samples (not analogue materials).In this machine, the pressure and temperature conditions of the sample can be adjusted to induce a phase transformation while the samples are deforming due to an applied stress.By measuring the deflection (diffraction) of X-rays through the crystals of the sample, which varies with how much stress the crystals in the sample feel, we are able to determine the stress on the sample.The X-ray beam also passes through the sample, hitting an X-ray detector behind the sample (just like in in an X-ray taken in a doctors office), producing an image of the sample.Thus, the X-rays provide a measure of stress (how hard we are pushing on the sample) and how much and how fast it flows (the strain and strain rate of the sample, respectively).By deforming samples while simultaneously changing the pressure until the sample undergoes a phase transformation, we are able to explore TP in real rocks at crustal and mantle conditions in the earth.We focused on two phase transformations that are important in the earths crust and mantle - the quartz-to-coesite transformation and the olivine-to-ringwoodite transformation, respectively.Studying the microstructures (microscopic structures in the rocks) after the experiments yields clues about how the rocks deform and details about the phase transformations.Using the data from our deformation experiments and microstructural data from analyzing the samples helps us test existing models of TP and develop new models that allow us to extrapolate to the earth with confidence.   This project provided educational support for one female postdoctoral investigator from WHOI.Our broad collaborative team of researchers from the University of Minnesota, WHOI and University of Pennsylvania included two graduate students, and one other female postdoctoral investigator. These early career researchers were trained through several collaborative visits to the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Lab.Our team has provided several training opportunities through participation in a beamline shadowing program coordinated by the NSF-sponsored In-Situ Studies of Rock Deformation (ISRD) research coordination network.
