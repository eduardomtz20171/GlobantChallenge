<AbstractNarration>Salish Kootenai College (SKC), in collaboration with the Blackfeet Native Science Field Center at Blackfeet Community College (BCC NSFC) and Hopa Mountain, a Bozeman, Montana based nonprofit organization are developing a Native Science Fellows effort. The project supports Native American undergraduate studentsâ€™ diverse pathways to geosciences careers by providing fellowships with science organizations, nonprofits and other tribal colleges. The project will also focus on active cohort groups to increase engagement in higher education and geosciences careers. Specific objectives of the initiative are to match promising tribal college and university students annually with hands-on field work and professional research experiences to build skills and pathways to academic and professional careers in the geosciences. These students will also be mentored by geosciences professionals and a supportive cohort network throughout the year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By creating three cohort groups of Fellows linked to two tribal colleges and universities, this initiative will be able to compare and contrast the pathways of these Fellows at each site to determine the most effective strategies to (1) increase the number of Indigenous students who are engaged in community-based geosciences research, field experiences and careers; (2) develop work and training programs for Indigenous tribal college and university students interested in the geosciences; (3) build a network of community-based science professionals who are committed to the success of Native American and Latino students and provide ongoing support for personal, academic and professional success; and (4) prepare these students to transfer to undergraduate or graduate school. These goals align with the GEO Education and Diversity Strategic Framework goals of developing a diverse, competitive, and engaged geosciences workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by The Directorate for Geosciences GEOPAths Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  National Science Foundation ICER - GEOPAths-Grad Opportunities GO    GP-GO: Native Science Fellows in Service (NSFiS)    Project Outcomes Report    The Native Science Fellows in Service project was a collaboration between Salish Kootenai College (SKC), the Blackfeet Native Science Field Center at Blackfeet Community College (BCC) and Hopa Mountain, a Montana based nonprofit organization based in Bozeman, Montana. The NSFiS project supported a community of over twenty-two Native American (NA) undergraduate students' diverse pathways to geoscience careers by providing service learning fellowships and training within geoscience organizations, including nonprofits, other tribal colleges and active cohort groups that support Indigenous knowledge and its interconnections to Western science. The overarching goal of the project was to increase Native undergraduate students access to authentic, culturally relevant service learning activities and field research experiences in the geosciences that will increase student engagement and retention in the geosciences degree programs.    The program did this by addressing twelve outcomes related to Integrated Learning, High Quality Service, Collaboration, Student Voice and Civic Responsibility  elements which they saw as key to engagement and retention of Native students in the geosciences. Over the course of 3-years, when asked at the end of the program whether the NSFiS program made progress toward its project outcomes, the majority of the Native Science Fellows indicated that the project made a great deal of progress. Students were asked to report on the progress they perceived related to: the development of student skill, knowledge and values that they could integrate into their everyday life, whether it provided opportunities for students to conduct research that responded to actual community needs identified by the community, and whether it engaged a diverse array of partners of whom both benefitted and contributed to the project. Students reported that they were active participants in all aspects of the project including identifying a project of interest, to planning and implementing the project in the community. Lastly, students felt that the program emphasized a responsibility to care for others, and make contributions to the community and make an impact with their geoscience knowledge.    The NSFiS project served a critical role in preparing students for future work in graduate programs and careers in the geosciences. Tracking of project participants indicate that students went on to pursue graduate degrees in the geosciences and/or accepted jobs upon graduation that contributed to Native communities.
