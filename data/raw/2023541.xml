<AbstractNarration>This project is a theoretical and computational study of turbulent double diffusion in the ocean. Double diffusion processes arise from the different rates/scales of salinity and temperature diffusion in the ocean under thermohaline conditions that can lead to turbulent mixing. The project employs asymptotic scaling approaches to render the equations of motion more tractable, facilitating detailed examinations of double diffusion. The development of new asymptotic models provides a unique capability to perform simulations of the salt-finger convection in the extreme oceanic regime. The underlying scaling assumptions of the asymptotic theory also provide a new strategy for rescaling the oceanic equations of motion that allows for greater numerical stability in probing this regime. New theories will be developed to help improve our understanding of the saturated states of salt-finger turbulence. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a comprehensive study of salt-finger convection valid in the oceanic regime of small salinity to thermal diffusivity ratio. This is accomplished by utilizing: novel asymptotically reduced models that extrapolate to extreme parameter settings; a new reformulation of the Navier-Stokes fluid equations that extends the stability and computational capabilities of direct numerical simulations; and theoretical analysis that dissects the flow morphology, energetics and multiscale nature of turbulent salt fingers. At present, direct numerical simulations of turbulent double diffusion are limited by the diffusivity ratio. Asymptotic models which filter computationally prohibitive fast internal waves and maintain an inertia-free balance will be employed. The reformulated Navier-Stokes fluid equations retain internal gravity waves but utilize the asymptotic rescalings of the spatial and temporal derivatives and field magnitudes and allow for comparison with reduced models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project partially supported the research of one postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Physics, University of California, Berkeley. Our work is largely motivated by the need to understand mixing in the oceans and elsewhere, and the role of double-diffusive processes in salt- and temperature-stratified fluid bodies.The focus is on understanding fundamental principles governing mixing processes and the development of novel techniques for assessing its importance.   The key outcomes of the project are:   1. Derivation and study of the dynamics of reduced models of saltfinger convection valid in the limit of very small diffusivity ratio in both two and three dimensions, focusing on the differences between these two cases. The reduction in order ispossible because here the slow field (salinity) drives the instability. A similar reduction in the diffusive (overstable) case is more involved since the flow is now driven by the fast field (temperature) while the slow field is stabilizing and requires a multiscale approach.   2. Detailed study of fixed-flux Rayleigh-Benard convection in horizontally and vertically periodic domains with a view to understanding different physical mechanisms that may lead to the saturation of elevator modes. One such mechanism leads to elevator mode tilt, followed by further instabilities leading to time-dependence. The tilting is found to be due to horizontal mean flow generation, an important process in fingering convection. A parallel study of fixed-flux saltfinger convection is under investigation. The fixed flux formulation is appropriate for ocean regions far from any boundaries.   3. Transitions in nonautonomous systems, motivated by geophysical applications such as systems with a slowly time-varying temperature or salinity profile, a growing or shrinking domain (for example, due to ice formation) or changing global temperature or CO_2 concentration are not amenable to classical stability theory and new techniques for studying pattern formation are required. The PI focused on transitions involving phase slips in a growing domain, an inevitable consequence of a preferred wavenumber, whereby new wavelengths are injected into the pattern as the domain grows. A new approach to front propagation in such systems was also developed.   4. Convection in an inclined porous medium may take the form of traveling localized structures when the boundary conditions break symmetry in the layer midplane. Structures of different lengths travel with different speeds and the outcome of the resulting interaction depends on the nature of the tails of the structures: when the proximate tails are both oscillatory bound states form, while a monotonic tail favors pulse repulsion and the formation of equispaced structures within the domain. The outcome of the interaction can therefore be predicted from the spatial eigenvalues of the base state, a conclusion confirmed through direct numerical simulations.   5. Irregular or stochastic switching between large scale vortex structures and jets is often observed in turbulent geophysical flows, including the Earth's atmosphere. Similar switching is found in two-dimensional turbulence in rectangulardomains with periodic boundary conditions. Here lifetimes of the competing states can be determined as a function of the parameter values; the resulting lifetime measurements show unambiguously that the transitions between the vortex and jet states are Poisson-distributed and hence constitute a memoryless process.
