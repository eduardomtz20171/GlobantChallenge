<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to greatly enhance the value of an existing ethnographic database of world cultures to users by improving their ability to search by meaning rather than words, and providing tools for visualizing and analyzing their results. This project will add semantic tags and data-mining functions with associated computer services to enhance eHRAF World Cultures, presently containing about 750,000 pages from 6,500 ethnographic documents covering over 330 world societies over time. Since its inception in 1949, the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) has developed and transformed information systems to facilitate the efficient retrieval of information on cultures of the world so that researchers from many different disciplines could arrive at better understanding of human behavior in all its variety. New semantic and data mining infrastructure developed by this project will assist in determining universal and cross-cultural aspects of a wide range of user selected topics, such as social emotion and empathy, economics, politics and use of space and time. The database can serve to examine the range of possibilities for human thought, knowledge, belief and behavior with respect to real-world problems faced today, such as: climate change; violence; disasters; epidemics; hunger; and war. Examining how and why cultures vary in similar circumstances is critical to improving policy, applied science, and basic scientific understandings of the human condition. Such knowledge is extremely valuable in understanding an increasingly globalized world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop advanced methods of working with text that can be applied from an extensible framework that deploys tools for analysis and retrieval. This services framework will be available for beginners and advanced researchers. Some methods can be applied in areas as far afield as AI and robotics, making AI solutions more human. Pattern extraction and linguistic analysis will be applied through AI tools to define a flexible logic for the contents of the documents. The project will result in: 1) improved relevance of search results though identifying finer grained topics in each paragraph in addition to the existing semantic tags; 2) establishing semantic links between the paragraphs in the database so that a researcher can follow topic trails more effectively; and 3) tools for management, analysis, visualization, and summarization of results, user initiated data mining and pattern identification. These will assist researchers identifying and testing hypotheses about the societies they investigate. In addition to working on the eHRAF World Cultures database, the project will provide open access services that any researcher can use to process and analyse their own material.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Goals included improved search capabilities, and tools that enable multistage automated summarizing, analysis and annotation of search results, including visualization, to serve users with a range of skills from basic to advanced.   Outcomes are availablefrom September 2024for public use on our incubator site,https://ethnoLab.hraf.net   Project Goals:  Improve indexing and search capabilities for more accurate and efficient retrieval of topically relevant ethnographic passages. Develop accessible machine learning models to support user identification of emerging themes and trends within the corpus. Implement natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enable indexing, semantic mapping, summarization and analysis of large sets of search returns. Develop visualization and other data exploration and analytic tools to support both intuitive and formal analysis of ethnographic data. The means to test hypotheses that arise from analysis. Develop web-based API for access to services and data through web applications, intermediate tools such as Jupyter Lab, and direct access to services for researcher developed methods. Provide rich subset of facilities for user-supplied documents. Adapt or develop instructional materials for comparative and cross-cultural research.    Project Outcomes:  Enhanced metadata for corpus entries using data mining techniques and natural language textual analysis. Services using metadata to implement project goals, including similarity search, contextual search, aggregating results, expressing semantic relations between terms, machine learning and natural language processing for data analysis and extraction, together with data visualization and other analytic tools. Web services framework that provides access to the databases, simplifying large-scale data processing and analysis.    To cater to diverse technical skill levels we provide multiple access points:  Web applications that support users exploring data using guided workflows with user options. JupyterLab workflow templates for more advanced users to conduct exploratory analyses and customize workflows. Researchers can directly interact with services and data using programming languages to develop their workflows.    Our incubator site is publicly available, hosting the services API, necessary intermediate metadata, and access to underlying ethnographic documents. All services are available to the public.

The project's educational products enable educators to demonstrate complex concepts through real-world data.

Overall, these advancements have potential to fundamentally change how ethnographic and cross-cultural research is conducted.   Broader Impacts:   Our project greatly expands the use and impact of eHRAF World Cultures as a powerful tool for exploring human history and culture.   The project expands how ethnographic and cross-cultural research can be done, widening the base of anthropologists, sociologists, policy makers and others, who can incorporate in-depth comparative ethnographic research methods and data into their larger projects. Broader impacts include:  Potential of paradigmatic change for Anthropology. Incorporation of ethnographic data into a wide range of research, education and policy-making. New opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. Enhancing public and professional understanding of human cultures. Development of more nuanced and culturally sensitive policies and practices.    Summary:   The project's outcomes significantly improve accessibility and usability for eHRAF World Cultures. Researchers, educators, and students engage with ethnography more effectively, gaining new insights into cultural diversity, enhancing understanding of human societies worldwide, and will have major impacts on the research community in Anthropology, Ethnography, Ethnology, other Social Sciences, Social, Economic, Medical, Multicultural and Climate Policy, and beyond.   The Human Relations Area Files is a strong base from which to promote and support these innovations within the broader research community. Adoption could support a paradigm shift in ethnographic and anthropological research, setting a foundation for future research.
