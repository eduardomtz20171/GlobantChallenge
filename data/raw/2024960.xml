<AbstractNarration>Chemical engineering education needs a new educational approach commensurate with the evolution and expansion of industry expectations via inclusion of key elements from several fields: pharmaceuticals, renewable energy, biotechnology, nanotechnology, nuclear engineering, and food and consumer products, among others. Given the impact of chemical engineering in these areas, practicing chemical engineers are expected to be technically knowledgeable in these broad areas and also skilled in communication and leadership. However, the typical chemical engineering undergraduate core curriculum has not adapted to prepare students for the multiple needs encompassed by the chemical industry. Most courses are content-driven and based on classical problems, making it challenging to integrate emerging industrial examples and practices. Communication skills and teamwork experience are mainly gained in senior level courses. Many current faculty members have limited industrial experience, and they are not fully aware of emergent, practical problems and applications derived from new industries. Much of the standard software used in industry is not available at universities, and broader chemical industry needs are not incorporated into course content. As a result, students are less motivated and/or engaged, get lost in content-driven learning while missing the big picture and applications of the concepts. They therefore often struggle to identify with the profession and are not ready for the workforce when they graduate. This project examines a unique experience in which a student-faculty-industry integrated community will be created to bridge the gap between industry needs and the competencies developed within chemical engineering undergraduate programs. This project will investigate the effects of multiple activities designed to impact professional identity formation and promote industry-related competencies. Knowledge and insights gained from the research will help engineering programs to analyze important aspects of industry engagements, the feasibility of implementation and impact on student outcomes and faculty professional learning. The results will allow engineering educators to improve the next generation’s skillset and better prepare them for the workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to integrate academic and industrial workplace competencies within engineering programs. Industry professionals and engineering educators will work together to deliver application-guided and fundamentals-driven education. Implementing the method in a sophomore course, one of the first courses in chemical engineering curriculum, the project will consider: (a) the industrial enculturation process in the classroom, (b) synergistic instruction and mentoring by faculty and industrial trainers, and (c) student interaction with industry professionals. During the project, students’ engineering identity and self-efficacy will be monitored via surveys, interviews and other tools. The result of this study will lead to better understanding of effective engineering education models and methods for the professional formation of engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
