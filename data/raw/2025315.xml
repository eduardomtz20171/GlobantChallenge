<AbstractNarration>Spatial orientation is arguably one of the fundamental tasks of human language, and speakers use an array of strategies to situate objects, give directions, and categorize landscape features. The languages spoken in regions near large oceans are particularly well-known for their reliance on the land-sea opposition for spatial orientation, and this distinction is reflected in vocabulary. Thus, one would locate a house as ‘landward’ or ‘seaward,' rather than ‘left’ or ‘right,’ or ‘north’ or ‘south.’ Crucially, spatial vocabulary is almost always accompanied by spatial gestures, such as pointing with hands, arms, head, or facial features. Often, these gestures are not just supplemental but play a critical role in conveying spatial meaning. Yet, most research on spatial language has focused solely on the speech stream rather than the visual component. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Drawing on cutting-edge methodology, this study uses video recordings to analyze spatial language and gesture in a language of the Austronesian language family. The study will provide novel data on a little-studied yet linguistically diverse area of the language family. Moreover, the research will provide critical new documentation of a minority language currently undergoing rapid language loss. Working with local collaborators, the doctoral student will collect high-quality audio and video recordings of natural speech as part of a community-driven documentation effort. These recordings will be supplemented by unpublished legacy archival data. Recordings will be transcribed, translated and annotated for spatial features, and correlations between spoken and gestural features will be noted. All collected data will be publicly archived. The analysis of language, space, and gesture in this language will broaden the scientific understanding of the nature of space in language. Further, gesture has hardly been studied and its relation to spatial communication remains poorly understood. Because the use of gesture varies areally, it is important to diversify the regions where gesture has been documented in order to broaden understanding of the multitudinous ways that gesture can facilitate communication. To do this, the study will employ novel methodologies that incorporate gesture as an essential part of linguistic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
