<AbstractNarration>Membrane-based filtration is widely used by industry for separating distinct components (ions, molecules, and particles) within mixtures. Membranes find use in applications ranging from wastewater treatment and desalination to chemical and biological product manufacturing. The performance of conventional membrane technology generally decreases over time as undesirable substances or solutes accumulate at the membrane's surface and within its pores, which is a process called "fouling." Membrane fouling eventually prevents the desired fluid from passing through the membrane, eventually requiring the membrane to be cleaned or replaced. Separate from the issue of fouling, membrane technology is currently inadequate for eliminating trace-level, low molecular weight organic pollutants from fluids. This project will develop a microwave-assisted membrane filtration process designed to improve filtration performance, enhance pollutant degradation, and mitigate membrane fouling. The research will support manufacturing of smart functional membrane systems for sustainable water and chemical treatment or purification via microwave-catalytic membrane filtration. Research activities will inform the creation of new teaching modules, laboratory manuals, innovative learning experiences, and professional development programs on catalytic and reactive membrane systems. Leveraging partnerships with professional societies and the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in STEM will be recruited to conduct summer research projects.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to develop a microwave-assisted membrane filtration process that introduces microwave-initiated catalysis directly within the membrane-based separation process. Microwaves are expected to penetrate the membrane matrix and energize the microwave-responsive catalysts to produce reactive radicals degrade pollutants and mitigate fouling. The irradiation of the membrane is further expected to cause rapid water vaporization and interfacial nanobubbling, minimizing fouling via a chemical-free process. Functionalized membrane fabrication processes will be developed, and the stability and reactivity of the membranes will be assessed. Fundamental understanding of formation kinetics of nanobubbles and radicals, pollutant degradation efficiency, and antifouling performance will also be developed for a suite of candidate catalysts and membrane materials and types. The study will also apply innovative techniques for in situ electrochemical assessment of catalyst activity and radical formation under microwave irradiation and evaluation of microwave penetration. The expected outcomes of this research are: (1) optimized fabrication processes for catalyst-coated ceramic membranes with tunable catalyst coating structures; (2) quantification of antifouling efficacy and degradation performance of the microwave-assisted filtration system; (3) understanding of the mechanisms of microwave-assisted Fenton-like reactions and nanobubbles/radical formation the role these processes play in pollutant degradation and fouling resistance; and (4) development of tunable, microwave-enabled reactive membrane systems that combine catalytic reactions and membrane filtration. The ultimate vision of the project is the transformation of passive membrane filtration processes into next-generation reactive membranes that proactively degrade water contaminants and prevent surface fouling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Traditional membrane filtration technology suffers from membrane fouling due to cake layer accumulation, concentration polarization or pores clogging by particles, colloids, macromolecules, or organic matters. Moreover, removal of trace-level, small-molecular sized or recalcitrant organic pollutants via membrane filtration is also a long-unresolved challenge. Membrane filtration processes that exhibit robust and stable filtration with antifouling and reaction-enabled functions are urgently needed for efficient water treatment or chemical separation. This project embarks on the fundamental research of microwave-assisted membrane filtration processes that were designed to improve filtration performance, enhance pollutant degradation and mitigate membrane fouling. Under microwave irradiation, the filtration process may involve the production of nanobubbles and hydroxyl radicals on membrane surface, where engineered microwave-responsible catalysts are coated. Functionalized membrane fabrication, stability, reactivity, and fundamental mechanisms such as how microwave irradiation promotes formation of nanobubbles and radicals, pollutant degradation efficiency, virus inactivation and antifouling performances were rigorously investigated. The ultimate goals were to transform passive membrane filtration to the next-generation reactive membranes that can proactively degrade contaminants, inactive virus and prevent surface fouling, and to enable novel membrane processes in chemical conversion and separation. This project (1) prepared and characterized different catalyst-coated membranes; (2) assessed filtration performance and membrane fouling/defouling behavior; (3) employed microwave-Fenton reactions to enhance degradation efficiency and fouling resistance with persistent organic pollutants; and (4) evaluated antivirus activity of functionalized membranes in both water and air filtration. Finally, in addition to the above research experiences and training, we assessed the microwave adsorption/heating performance of MXene coated air filter for air disinfection. This research demonstrated that with just 0.05 mg&#8729;cm&sup2; of MXene, surfaces reached 104&deg;C under 125W in only three seconds, achieving a 98% &plusmn; 1% removal rate for the MS2 virus species. The oxidation of MXene under microwave heating enhanced its dipolar and interfacial polarization, promoting heating efficiency and stability, ensuring performance in high-humidity settings. These findings represent significant advancements in understanding the interaction between microwave irradiation and catalyst-coated filter, providing a foundation for further research and potential applications in aerosol virus inactivation technologies.</p> <p>The major outcomes of this project are multifaceted and composed of journal publications, professional conference presentations, student research training, proposal writing training, development of new research methods and teaching materials. First, the project results in seven journal publications with one under review. For example, we developed the microwave-enhanced membrane filtration system with microwave responsive catalyst (BiFeO<sub>3</sub>) coated ceramic membrane for the effective perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) degradation and viral inactivation in water. In addition, this research also evaluates the microwave penetration in this system by simulating the interfacial electromagnetic and heating distribution of microwave catalyst under microwave irradiation with COMSOL Multiphysics. This work promoted our understanding of fundamental mechanisms for molecular interactions (e.g., PFOA and virus) on microwave responsive catalyst and explained surface-mediated reactions or interfacial processes on metal oxide surfaces in water under microwave irradiation.</p> <p>Over the four-year project, nine oral and ten poster presentations were delivered at ACS Annual Conference, NAMS and Sustainable Nanotechnology Organization Annual Meeting et, al. In addition, this work was recognized by nine awards. One PhD student at NJIT has been supported to complete most of the research tasks. Moreover, one master and five undergraduate students and three high school students were involved via various educational programs at NJIT such as Undergraduate Research Innovation (URI), The Garden State LSAMP (Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation) and Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP). The PhD student also interacted with industrial partners through the NSF INTERN program that learned essential skills or knowledge of practical filtration technologies in real life remediation industries and accumulate practical experiences in tackling membrane filtration system problems when treating real contaminated water such as membrane fouling. The research activities also promoted the development of novel teaching modules that enhanced both undergraduate and graduate curricula or research training opportunities. For example, the URI students and other student interns were able to learn the principle of microwave heating and run the microwave assisted membrane filtration system for contaminant removal and bacterial/virus disinfection with the direct training from the supported Ph.D. student. Students also had the opportunity to learn about the standard operation method of LC-QQQ/mass for the detection of contaminants. For example, a high school intern involved in our water disinfection experiment, which enabled her to participate in multiple science competitions, including the New Jersey Regional Science Fair and the Jersey Shore Junior Science Symposium. The Ph.D. student also achieved many national awards and recognitions such as the 2024 Elmeryl Davies Memorial Scholarship from New Jersey Licensed Site Remediation Professionals Association, 2023 Grand Prize for University Research in the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists (AAEES) Excellence in Environmental Engineering and Science Competition, 2021 John J.
