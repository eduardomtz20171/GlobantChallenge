<AbstractNarration>Finding a sustainable solution to our growing needs for food and renewable energy production under a variable climate remains a grand challenge. This project will examine the potential for co-locating food and renewable energy production on the same parcel of land – a practice called ‘agrivoltaics’. Growing food in the understory of a canopy of solar photovoltaic panels may lead to multiple benefits, including increasing the efficiency of land use, while reducing the need for impacting natural landscapes. However, both crops and solar panels are sensitive to changes in temperature and climate. This comparative research will link field measurements of plant and solar panel performance in a traditional setting and this novel co-location system to determine the costs and benefits of agrivoltaics. This research will be conducted across multiple dryland environments to broaden scientific learning about how well suited agrivoltaics is to different climates, irrigation laws, and social contexts. Local farmers, K-12 students from traditionally underrepresented groups, and university partners will lead the research and education efforts. The food produced in the study will be shared with the community, along with the scientific findings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food and energy security are national priorities. Both require land for production and are sensitive to changes in temperature and climate. Mounting demands for food and energy will only increase competition for land dedicated to their production. Co-locating food and energy production can have positive impacts across food, energy, and water systems by taking a more holistic systems approach and focusing the research across multiple dryland environments that vary in terms of temperature, timing of precipitation, and social context. Using a blend of field measurements and numerical modeling, this project will assess the impacts of agrivoltaics in terms of altering how water, carbon, and energy move through an ecosystem in terms of micrometeorological impacts, carbon cycling and storage, food and energy production, and mitigating sensitivities to environmental pressures. From a food system perspective, this research will determine 1) how being grown in the shade of solar panels can ease plant stress to high light and water demands, 2) how it might extend the growing season of crops, and 3) how much the shading of soils help slow evaporation, thus reducing the need for irrigation in drylands. From an energy perspective, the research will examine how much a solar panel can be cooled by the passive process of transpirational water loss from an understory of crops. Co-locating food and energy production may not only reduce land use conflicts, but also increase the production of more marginal lands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

This project examined the potential for co-locating food and renewable energy production on the same parcel of land &ndash; a practice called &lsquo;agrivoltaics&rsquo;. Through research supported by this award, we have demonstrated that growing food in the understory of a canopy of solar photovoltaic panels can create multiple benefits, including increasing the efficiency of land use, reducing the need for impacting natural landscapes, and actually benefitting both forms of production. Crops and solar panels are sensitive to temperature, so a warming environment will negatively impact both. This project&rsquo;s research has linked field measurements of plant and solar panel performance in traditional setting and this novel co-location system to determine the costs and benefits of agrivoltaics. We have quantified how well shading from the solar panels reduces plants&rsquo; environmental stress and how well the process of transpiration from those plants can cool down those overstory solar panels. Most importantly, this research has been conducted across multiple dryland environments to broaden scientific learning about how well suited agrivoltaics is to different climates, irrigation laws, and societal interests. We engaged local farmers, K-12 students from traditionally underrepresented groups, and university partners to conduct the research and education efforts, with the food produced in the study shared with the community, along with the scientific findings.<br /><br />Food security: We built on initial findings that co-locating food and energy production can have positive impacts across food, energy, and water systems and took a more holistic systems approach and conducted our research across multiple dryland environments that vary in terms of temperature, timing of precipitation, and social demands for change. We blended field measurements and numerical modeling to assess the impacts of agrivoltaics in terms of altering how water, carbon, and energy move through an ecosystem in terms of micrometeorological impacts, carbon cycling and storage, food and energy production, and mitigating sensitivities to environmental pressures. We quantified the degree to which being grown in the shade of solar panels can ease plant stress to high light and water demands, how it can extend the growing season of crops, and how much the shading of soils help slow evaporation, thus reducing the need for irrigation in drylands. Ultimately, we repeated these measurements on over 50 different varieties and types of crops, and we disseminated these findings in peer-reviewed publications, webinars, presentations at local schools, and in public hearings with county and state officials across Arizona and Colorado.<br /><br />Renewable energy: From an energy perspective, we quantified how much a solar panel can be cooled by the passive process of transpirational water loss from an understory of crops, which is important because a solar panel&rsquo;s efficiency declines linearly with increasing temperature. We were able to demonstrate that the degree of solar panel cooling varies due to geographic location (and the associated climate) and the crops within the agrivoltaics system, but that the cooling effect could be as large as 10 degrees Celsius. Using numerical modeling from the National Renewable Energy Lab, we found that this can increase solar panel efficiency by 3-5%, depending on the season. We found that synergies from co-locating food and energy production may not only reduce land use conflicts, but also increase the production of more marginal lands.<br /><br />Education: Two graduate students were supported by this funding to complete their research. Students documented (no) differences in taste preferences for crops grown within an agrivoltaics versus a traditional farming system &ndash; indicating that the presence of solar had no negative impacts on food quality. However, surveys showed that a majority of the public would pay more for crops produced within an agrivoltaic setting (despite no difference in taste) because of their association with renewable energy production. More than 10 undergraduate and 10 high school students participated in our agrivoltaics research, providing opportunities of interdisciplinary and experiential experiences in the field and lab. All these students delivered presentations to their peers and the public, giving them the chance to speak publicly about their work and experiences.</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 07/18/2024<br> Modified by: Greg&nbsp;Barron-Gafford</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2025727/2025727_10686218_1721342925820_Governor_Polis_at_Jacks_Solar_Garden--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2025727/2025727_10686218_1721342925820_Governor_Polis_at_Jacks_Solar_Garden--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Agrivoltaics: Gov.
