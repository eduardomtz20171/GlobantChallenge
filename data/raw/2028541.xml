<AbstractNarration>Injection of aerosols into the stratosphere, an approach known as stratospheric aerosol climate intervention, has been suggested as a strategy to compensate for anthropogenic global warming. Much research has focused on climate changes associated with stratospheric aerosol climate intervention (also called stratospheric aerosol geoengineering â€“ SAG), but only a few studies have addressed its potential societal impacts, in particular global agricultural productivity. This project will examine how anticipated climate changes from SAG, compared with the present and a future without SAG, would interact with the global agriculture system, influence crop growth, and impact world food production. Spatially explicit climate changes considered here associated with SAG include less total solar radiation, more diffuse solar radiation, reduced surface temperature, changed precipitation, changed surface ozone concentration, and different global mean CO2 levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a multidisciplinary collaboration to evaluate global agriculture impacts of SAG with an integrated assessment framework, including a state-of-the-art Earth System Model linked to multiple mechanistic crop models. These models are targeted to advance the frontier of process-based crop modeling with representations of ozone damage and diffuse radiation in photosynthesis processes. Impact uncertainties will be systematically quantified through the model ensemble setup and multi-crop model assessment, and by using different downscaling methods for climate forcing data. Detailed impacts of individual climate factors on crop yields will be studied, while considering feedbacks from the agriculture system to the anticipated SAG climate impacts. The results of this project will provide new quantitative evidence of SAG implications for world food production in view of present day and potential future climates without SAG. The project will foster communication between the climate modeling community (including the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project) and the crop modeling community (the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project), to advance understanding of agricultural impacts under global warming and a future climate with stratospheric aerosol intervention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Our project investigated impacts on agriculture of proposed geoengineering (climate intervention) schemes to reduce global warming. In particular we looked at the impacts of an artificial cloud produced in the upper atmosphere, which could reflect sunlight, cooling Earths surface and changing the precipitation patterns. This is called stratospheric aerosol intervention (SAI). To do this, we used a global climate model and multiple process-based crop models. This pioneering project brought together multiple disciplines to assess one of the most important SAI impacts - its effect on agricultural system.   Our research has yielded significant insights into the complex impacts of SAI on crop production. Global warming is produced by an increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to human emissions. This increased carbon dioxide is beneficial to many crops. By using SAI to reduce the warming that this carbon dioxide would have caused, this can also benefit crops that are not tolerant of heat, such as corn. One of the standard scenarios we investigated is called SSP2-4.5*, which would produce a global warming of about 2.7C by the end of the 21st century. We used scenarios that would inject enough sulfur into the stratosphere to limit the warming to only 0.5C, 1C, and 1.5C.   One of our critical findings is that different countries would reach their maximum crop production potential under different SAI strategies (Figure 1). For example, some nations benefit more from SSP2-4.5 without any SAI (countries colored blue), while others require varying level of SAI to reach their maximum crop production. Countries colored red, such as the U.S. and China, would need the strongest SAI strategy, aiming for global averaged temperature 0.5C higher than the pre-industrial level. Countries colored green, such as Canada, would benefit from a temperature target of 1.0C, while countries colored orange, such as Mongolia, would need the mildest temperature adjustment with a target of 1.5C higher than the pre-industrial level. This finding is crucial as it underscores the complexity of researching and designing global solar climate intervention strategies. It also highlights the importance and potential conflicts of customized strategies for SAI to meet the specific needs of different regions.   Moreover, our pilot project in collaboration with the Global Gridded Crop Modeling Initiative (GGCMI) revealed substantial uncertainties inherent in simulating country-level crop production under SAI. With the same climate forcing from SSP2-4.5 and sulfur injection to limit the global averaged temperature to 1.5C higher than pre-industrial, the three process-based crop models show different responses. To effectively inform policymakers about the impact of SAI on agriculture, it is urgent to undertake research actions for a comprehensive assessment of crop models within the context of various SAI scenarios to provide robust insights into the potential implications of climate intervention on global food production.   This project also improved the crop module of the Community Land Model (CLM) to allow the use of externally specified crop planting dates and maturity requirements. In this way, CLM can use alternative algorithms for future crop calendars that are potentially more accurate and/or flexible than the built-in methods. Using observation-derived planting and maturity inputs reduces bias in the mean simulated global yield of sugarcane and cotton but increases bias for corn, spring wheat, and especially rice.
