<AbstractNarration>The prosperity of the US manufacturing industry is dependent upon the ability to remain at the forefront of new material technologies and manufacturing processes. In this context, 3-D printing of metallic components has emerged as a game changer in many industries where the potential to build geometrically complex components promises to increase the performance and life-cycle sustainability of high value products. However, utilization of these components in safety-critical applications is hindered by the lack of suitable methods to detect manufacturing defects or subsequent damage that develops while a component is in service. If left undetected, these defects can lead to catastrophic failures and result in great financial losses or even loss of life. This study seeks to bridge this gap by expanding the range of applicability of ultrasonic testing, a widely used method for the noninvasive inspection of simple shape components. The goal is to introduce a new material specifically designed to couple ultrasonic signals with the bulk of geometrically complex components. The material will be a new form of ice loaded with solid particles to yield tunable rigidity and mass density which are critical for the effectiveness of ultrasonic testing. This project will develop educational modules for three different courses at Penn State and the University of Cincinnati and train graduate and undergraduate students supported by the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance the progress of science by creating novel models of wave propagation in particle composites that enable the design of these tunable coupling solids (i.e., reinforced ice). This study will investigate the effects of microstructural modifications in ice composites on wave propagation and scattering through experimentally validated multiscale models. The project will create a new mathematical framework to model wave propagation in particle reinforced composites that lies at the convergence of physics-based analytical approaches and numerical unit cell methods. By merging analytical and data-driven strategies, this work will uncover innovative multiscale approaches to the study of wave propagation in media with complex microstructures. Understanding the impact of particle addition on the dynamic response of ice will enable the analysis of wave propagation in generalized particle composite structures, which will extend far beyond the described application. The increased efficiency in the joint numerical and analytical approach combined with the optimization algorithms will fundamentally change the fields of elastodynamic modeling and ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The work conducted under this award has laid the foundation for a new generation of ultrasonic couplants that will be instrumental for the nondestructive inspection of complex-shape components built with additive manufacturing methods. In previous investigations conducted by the PI, the use of polycrystalline ice was proposed as an alternative to conventional water immersion coupling, leading to a technique that is now commonly referred to as Cryo-ultrasonic testing (Cryo-UT). The relatively high velocity of  compressional waves in ice and its  ability to support the propagation of shear waves, significantly  strengthen the ultrasonic transmission through curved interfaces over l water coupling. Within the socpe of this award, the possibility of further enhancincing the ultrasonic properties of ice by dispersing solid particles in water before it is froze, has been considered for the very first time. This is a major step forward in the development of Cryo-UT as it is now possible to produce coupling materials that better match the ultrasonic velocities and mass density of metallic alloys. Although the concept of using ice composites may appear straightforward, there are many technical and scientific challenges that we had to address and which have led to some fundamental discoveries. Specific elements of this researc which are innovative and groundbreaking include:    We have provided the first experimental demonstration that it is possible to increase the ultrasonic velocities and mass density of ice while limiting ultrasonic attenuation. This was a significant challenge because aqueous dispersions tend to form lamellar structures when they freeze that cause anisotropy and lead to very high ultrasonic attenuation. A couplant with high ultrasonic attenuation would be of no use in nondestructive testing.  We have discovered that there is a glass transition that occurs at around -100 C and which is critical to achieve low ultrasonic attenuation. All previous studies based on calorimetry indicated that the solidification of the material was completed at -20C. Our work therefore provides a new insight into the freezing process.  We have discovered that the concentration of dispersant used to maintain the particles suspended in water has a major impact on the velocity and attenuation of the ice composite after full solidification  We have provided the first experimental evidence that the particles do not compromise the strength of the adhesion of ice to the surface of the metal. This is critical to ensue that ultrasonic power is transmitted through the composite-metal interface.  We have built a novel experimental apparatus to continuously monitor the ultrasonic properties of the dispersions as they freeze down to temperatures in the order of -150 C. This was a major technical challenge and indeed we are not aware of any other ultrasonic monitoring study that was performed at these low temperatures  We have outlined the full process to test components in the ice composite including the preparation of the dispersion, freezing method, removal of the composite at end of the inspection, and recycling of the particles. Although in our work this process has been limited to composites formed with alumina nanoparticles it is applicable to other material particles. We expect that by using different particles it will be possible to further increase the ultrasonic velocities and mass density of the composite and so reduce contrast with the properties of metals to a level similar to the contrast observed in medical ultrasound of soft tissue. This is a very exciting prospect and it is why we consider ice composites as a new generation of ultrasonic couplants         Last Modified: 12/06/2024       Submitted by: FrancescoSimonetti]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
