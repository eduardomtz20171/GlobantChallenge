<AbstractNarration>This project supports a series of workshops that bring together a diverse group of science professionals and experienced law school faculty to develop effective practices in communicating complex science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) concepts to non-scientists in a range of challenging communication settings.  To communicate and teach effectively, scientists must understand how to explain their work to audiences who are not scientists and lack understanding of complex scientific principles. Scientists must not be an advocate for one side or the other, but they must be able to convey the substance, quality, and accuracy of their work.  The main objective is to improve participantsâ€™ abilities to communicate and teach complex STEM concepts to non-scientists in a variety of formal settings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the workshops, participants learn and practice the role of both scientists and non-scientists in order to: 1) develop and build upon skills necessary to effectively communicate their expertise; 2) understand the culture and perspectives of nonscientists; and 3) develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of the different challenges in communicating and teaching complex STEM concepts to non-scientists. The workshops demonstrate the merit of experiential learning and provide hands-on practice opportunities with individualized feedback and coaching during the workshops.  Participants also discuss ethical issues concerning communicating and teaching STEM concepts to non-scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential Broader Impacts (B.I.) involve providing an immersive hands-on learning and demonstration experience in communicating complex science in a novel communication venue for scientists and in collaboration with legal professionals.  This collaboration helps bridge the gap in understanding the culture norms and ethical considerations of the two professional communities that increasingly interact over technical issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  2024 Project Outcomes Report   Disclaimer   This Project Outcomes Report for the General Public is displayed verbatim as submitted by the Principal Investigator (PI) for this award. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.  Award Title:Effectively      Communicating Science Workshops (2021-2024); Saint Paul, Minnesota Federal Award ID:2030043 Report Submission Period:05/01/2024 to 07/31/2024       The "Effectively Communicating Science" ("ECS") project is a series of annual one-week long workshops and ongoing support materials for scientists on communicating and teaching. The primary goals of the ECS are to train and equip scientists and science educators (hereafter, the project "participants") to communicate and teach complex STEM concepts more effectively and ethically.   We conducted four ECS workshops with NSF funding in 2011-14 (Award numbers 1041512 and 1321562); three ECS workshops in 2015-17 (Award number 1540197); and three additional ECS workshops in 2018-2020 (note that the 2020 workshop was a pilot session due to COVID-19) (Award 1822444).Three ECS workshops were held in 2021-2023 (Award 2030043). A total of 208 scientists have participated in this program to date.   Design/Intellectual Merit   The workshop methodology applies two core assumptions:1) scientists learn best by doing rather than just listening and observing and 2) scientists betterunderstand how to communicate STEM concepts by learning about, interacting with, and playing the role of policy-makers, lawyers, and others who are not scientifically trained.   Participants were carefully selected by their level of experience and standing in the scientific community. The participants also represented a diverse group of scientists. For example, the participants included a balance of male and female scientists that included all levels of professional experience from Ph.D. candidates to seasoned professors and professional scientists with a broad range of ages. The participants hailed from many states and different educational and research institutions.   The week-long experiential learning program included briefings by professors and other professionals, including judges, lawyers, and communication consults, on topics such as: ethical considerations in communication, communicating scientific and STEM topics to non-scientists, and various legal and policy processes where scientific information is commonly communicated (such as strategy and communication meetings with non-scientists, direct and cross-examination, legislative hearing, pretrialDauberthearing, , and jury trial). In addition, participants received training materials and other resources for ongoing support, including communication texts and articlesand website resources.   As with previous workshops, law students were included each year (with no additional costs to the grant) to provide additional training and communication experiences for the participants, as well as provide the law students with intensive hands-on educational experience with scientists in legal settings, using the training materials developed in this program.   Broader Impacts of the Program   Participants in the ECS workshops bring their training back to their workplace and schools, where they share what they have learned and their new or improved skills with constituents, colleagues, students, and policy makers. Then they recommend a new batch of participants, who are then able to participate in the program the next year. Nearly all the 208 scientists who have participated in the program were recommended by previous participants.   The need for this type of training is clear. Science and complex STEM concepts are key factors in the strategic plans of many major corporations, public policy discussions, legal disputes, and in the education of future scientists and science educators. Communication and teaching of these concepts to non-scientists is critical, as non-scientists are often in the role of decision-maker on issues involving science and complex STEM concepts.   Outcomes   We measure the results of the ECS workshops in two ways. The first measure is the number of scientists who participate in the program. Each workshop serves a new group of scientists and educators. All participants are considered "Fellows" after completion of the program and receive ongoing access to the ECS portal and its many resources. Fellows are also encouraged to keep in touch with the program and share results of the workshop in their work and teaching, as many have already done.   The second measure is the level of satisfaction of participants along several important vectors. We use a complex survey instrument that is administered shortly after completion of the workshop. For every question in every workshop, the responses were nearly unanimously positive, matching the affirmative results from previous ECS workshops.
