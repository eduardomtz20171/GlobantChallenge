<AbstractNarration>This project is a research-practice partnership involving the Santa Clara County Office of Education, Krause Center for Innovation at Foothill DeAnza College, San Jos√© State University College of Science Center for STEM Education, WestEd, and the Berryessa Union, Milpitas Unified, and Orchard Elementary School Districts.  It is supporting 4th and 5th grade teachers to adopt culturally-responsive teaching and studying how this impacts the identities of Latinas as they relate to computational thinking (CT) and computer science (CS). Female Latina students are one of the populations that presently are among the least likely to engage in CS or to pursue CS-related careers. Although it is widely accepted that early interventions are critical to engage underrepresented students in STEM, there is a dearth of opportunities for students to effectively engage with CS and CT skills as part of their classroom instruction.  The study focuses on addressing this and developing among Latinas positive identity around foundational CT skills, particularly algorithmic thinking and abstraction as they relate to mathematics. The project activities are preparing teachers to effectively teach abstraction and algorithmic thinking and assess CT practices; developing CT activities for 4th &amp; 5th grade that are culturally responsive and that promote positive identity among Latinas; and assessing the effectiveness of these curricula towards improving positive identity and math achievement in classrooms serving predominantly minority youth in the 4th and 5th grades.  In total, this project is impacting 1400 students and among them, at least 350 Latina students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central objective of this project is to apply culturally responsive teaching to computational thinking practices that will provide an opportunity to support positive identity in STEM in Latina girls. The first activity in achieving this objective is developing professional learning for 4th and 5th grade educators using Critical Race Theory and other culturally responsive teaching methods that use the Framework for Multicultural Curriculum Design (Sleeter et al., 2005). The strategy is to integrate CT into mathematics and other curricula through a modified Engage-Investigate Model-Apply  progression. Teachers then use these culturally responsive methods to create positive identity with the content. Teacher practice is being assessed on the CT Practices of algorithms and abstraction, but specifically on abstraction as well as on related ideas in mathematics to determine if there is a tertiary effect on increasing math scores. A mixed-methods study is exploring the impacts of the curricula and professional development through observations, data collection on student work, and attitudinal surveys. This project is funded by the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       The Silicon Valley Research Practice Partnership for Computational Thinking and Positive Identity for Computer Science (SVRPP for CT & PICS)had three primary objectives:    1. Establish and support a Research Practice Partnership (RPP) that provides teachers with experiences that develop the knowledge and skills needed for effective teaching of computational thinking (CT) (Abstraction) and assessment of these CT practices.    2. Develop CT activities for 4th and 5th grade that are culturally responsive, promote positive identity among students, particularly Latina students, and focus on skill development specifically in the area of Abstraction.    3. Assess the effectiveness of the curricula towards improving positive identity and mathematics achievement in classrooms serving predominantly minority youth in the 4th and 5th grades.    Primary Objective 1    The SVRPP established an RPP to provide teachers with the knowledge and skills needed for effective teaching of CT, specifically Abstraction. The SVRPP scaled from six practitioners: two teachers with relevant expertise from each of the three partner school districts, and six researchers (Year 1) to 11 practitioners from four school districts and six researchers (Year 2). In its final year (Year 3), the partnership included 28 practitioners from eight school districts and six researchers.    The SVRPP adapted its partnership and professional learning activities from in-person to online formats during the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling the program to continue without interruption. This flexibility maintained momentum ensuring continued support and growth for teachers and students despite the challenges of the pandemic&#8203;.    Primary Objective 2    Teachers developed and implemented reimagined mathematics tasks that integrated Abstraction and CT with culturally responsive pedagogies. These tasks engaged students meaningfully and strengthened their positive identities within STEM, particularly for Latinx girls.    In response to the 2022-23 school year (SY) findings, the SVRPP introduced a rubric focused on cultural responsiveness in 2023-24 SY. This tool guided teachers in refining their tasks to ensure that cultural relevance was thoughtfully integrated, further supporting positive student outcomes.    Primary Objective 3    To assess the effectiveness of the curriculum towards improving positive identity and mathematics achievement in classrooms serving predominantly minority youth in the 4th and 5th grades, the SVRPP was guided by the following four research questions:    1. What is the impact of the Silicon Valley RPP for CT and PICS on the skills and understanding of Abstraction among Latina students in grades 4 and 5?    2. How does the Silicon Valley RPP for CT and PICS impact the mathematics achievement for Latina students in grades 4 and 5?    3. What is the impact of the Silicon Valley RPP for CT and PICS on the positive identiry of Latina students in grades 4 and 5?    4. What culturally relevant instructional strategies for integrating CT with mathematics are being used to support positive identity for Latina students in grades 4 and 5?    Research Question 1 - Improvement in students' CT skills    The SVRPP significantly impacted the understanding of students in computational thinking, particularly Abstraction, as seen in the substantial gains in CT assessment scores for Latina students and the broader student group across 2022-23 and 2023-24. This outcome highlights the effectiveness of SVRPP in equipping students with foundational CT skills relevant to STEM fields&#8203;.    Research Question 2 - Improvement in mathematics achievement         The 2023-24 SY analysis, including Latinx fourth graders, revealed a statistically significant difference in SBAC mathematics scores for students taught by SVRPP teachers compared to their peers with non-SVRPP teachers. This statistically significant difference, underscores the effectiveness of the reimagined mathematics tasks developed by the SVRPP. In fifth grade, Latinx students also benefited, although the difference was not statistically significant. These findings highlight the potential for expanding the reimagined tasks beyond fourth grade. They also underscore the need to refine fifth-grade reimagined mathematics tasks, guiding future research and development. A previous year's analysis showed higher scores for Latina students with SVRPP teachers compared to similar Latina students with non-SVRPP teachers. However the difference was not statistically significant.    Research Question 3 - Enhanced positive identity and engagement for Latina students         Latina students experienced statistically significant increased positive identity scores related to culturally responsive pedagogy in 2023-24 SY, marking progress toward the SVRPP's goal of fostering a supportive environment that affirms identity and enhances engagement for underrepresented students in STEM. However, there was no statistically positive increase in the 2022-23 SY.        Research Question 4 - Increased teacher capacity in culturally responsive pedagogy and CT knowledge         Teachers involved in the SVRPP made statistically significant gains in culturally responsive pedagogy during the 2022-23 SY, reflecting enhanced understanding and application of culturally relevant instructional practices. During the 2023-24 SY, a similar trend was observed, though not statistically significant.    Overall, the SVRPP demonstrated achievements in enhancing teacher capacity, supporting student identity in STEM, and creating a sustainable, adaptable partnership model that can serve as a foundation for future educational initiatives in computational thinking and culturally responsive pedagogy.
