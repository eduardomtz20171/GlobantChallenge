<AbstractNarration>The project is being developed by an existing research-practice partnership (RPP) comprised of Broward County Public Schools, UChicago STEM Education, and the University of Florida. One goal is to create curriculum units that integrate computer science (CS) with other disciplines for PreK-8 students. The specific deliverable will be a unit on invasive species that incorporates science, social studies, and CS content and activities. The module's design will be based on culturally-responsive pedagogy and Universal Design for Learning to address the needs of learners with disabilities and African-American and Hispanic youth. A second goal is to study the student outcomes related to students' academic achievement, computer science proficiency, and attitudes towards computer science. Code.org, one of the largest providers of K-12 computer science content, has agreed to distribute the module to schools nationwide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an implementation study, the research will investigate the module curriculum's impact on student academic achievement, CS proficiency, and CS attitudes. It will also determine which components of the module were most impactful for whom and under what conditions. The researchers will frame these contributions in the broader context of equity. Specifically, the project will generate knowledge about aspects of the intervention that promoted equitable academic and attitudinal outcomes across all groups of young learners. Finally, this project will contribute to knowledge about RPP improvement and RPP engagement with the educational system. The research team will pursue the answers to these questions through a quasi-experimental implementation study. An evaluation of the research-practice partnership itself will also be conducted to contribute to knowledge on the collaborative design and implementation process. This project is funded by the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       This project focused on broadening participation in science and technology by creating an instructional unit called Invasive Species. This unit is among the first (if not the first)to include a coherent set of (20) lessons that integrate Science and CS in a way that utilizes Problem-Based Learning (PBL), Universal Design for Learning (UDL), and Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP) principles. As such, it created opportunities for elementary teachers (who may have limited understanding of how to integrate these disciplines and practices) to teach project-based science and CS in a manner that brings personal relevance and interest to students.    An important step in creating the module was the development of a crosswalk document that demonstrated the relationship between PBL, CRP and UDL. Each of these ideas is very complex so it was essential to be able to be clear about what parts of PBL, CRP and UDL we were focusing on and how they related to each other.    Additionally, the project team created a set of educative videos. The videos introduce teachers to the unit, but also provide important guidance on UDL and CRP.    The project also conducted important research focused on two areas. First, the team developed measures for understanding the use of CRP and UDL in elementary classrooms. Prior to this project, there were few, if any such measures. These measures are important to understand use of these instructional approaches in classrooms as well as the impact of the strategies when they are present. It was important for this project to be very specific about the different parts of UDL and CRP that were most impactful and focus only on those aspects of CRP and UDL in the measures.    The project also explored the impact of the unit on student outcomes and generated quite a few significant findings.
