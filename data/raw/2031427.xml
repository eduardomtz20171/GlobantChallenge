<AbstractNarration>The project will 1) determine accessibility issues students with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) would face with a computational thinking (CT) curriculum designed for mainstream students, 2) design instructions to make an existing CT curriculum for mainstream students accessible to students with ASD, 3) implement the accessible CT curriculum in one school and the original CT curriculum in another school for students with ASD, and 4) compare the effectiveness of the accessible CT curriculum to the original one to evaluate its success. This will be the first study to design, develop, implement, and evaluate an accessible CT curriculum for students with ASD. It intends to provide a publicly accessible CT curriculum resource with learning objectives, instructional design and information presentation methods, assessments, feedback, learning environments, and professional development materials to teach CT to students with ASD. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaboration between expert practitioners and researchers working together to accomplish two objectives. The first objective is to identify adaptations and accommodations to make an existing computational thinking (CT) curriculum accessible to students with ASD. This objective will be accomplished by 1) analyzing seventh graders’ characteristics at a school for students with ASD, and 2) developing adaptations and accommodations to make an existing CT curriculum developed for mainstream students accessible to the seventh-grade students. The data to be collected for this objective consists of systematic documentation of the adaptations and accommodations, including learning objectives, instructional design, information presentation, assessments, feedback, and learning environment. The second objective is to implement the accessible CT curriculum at one school and the original one without the adjustments at another school for students with ASD, and test its effectiveness in improving students with ASDs’ learning of CT concepts (CTCs) and increasing their development of fluency in CT practices (CTPs) through two-group repeated measures study. The data to be collected for this objective will include pre- and post-tests to measure students’ learning of CTCs and two artifact-based interviews to measure their development of fluency in CTPs. ANCOVA tests will determine if the accessible CT curriculum was effective in differentiating the two groups on their learning of CTCs and their development of fluency in CTPs. This will be the first study to design, develop, implement, and test an accessible CT curriculum for students with ASD, and will provide the first publicly accessible CT curriculum repository for students with ASD. This project is funded by the CS for All program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Participants &amp; Broader Impacts: </strong>A total of 47 students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) participated in this study: 24 in the second year, 12 in the third, and 11 in the fourth. Additionally, 6 teachers, 7 undergraduate students, and 7 graduate students were involved and directly benefited from the project over its four-year span. Before this project, few teachers working with students with ASD had received any training in computing. The project offered extensive training through 150 professional development workshops, covering topics like Scratch block-based programming, both the accessible and original computing curricula, assessment systems, data collection and analysis, and teaching methods for students with ASD. Regular meetings ensured teachers, students, and coordinators were on the same page, and yearly workshops were held to review progress and make plans for the following year. These activities provided valuable information for all participants. At the end of the second and third years, "Showcase Days" allowed students with ASD to present their computing projects. A total of 25 students participated, receiving medals and certificates in front of their families, school staff, and the public. These events, which raised awareness of the project, were covered by local media. Unfortunately, no summer coding camp was organized because there was little interest from students, as shown by the lack of responses to a Google Form distributed to schools. The COVID-19 pandemic was a significant factor, especially during the second and partly the third year of the project.</p> <p><strong>Accommodations &amp; Adaptations: </strong>In the project's first year, students' individual needs (e.g., prior knowledge, interests, social, neurological, and physiological traits) were assessed to develop appropriate adaptations &amp; accommodations. These included breaks, sensory activities, alternative communication methods, extended time, breaking lessons into smaller chunks, offering additional practice, pairing students with college students, using picture cues, and relocating students to calm areas when needed.</p> <p><strong>Accessible Computing Curriculum: </strong>After developing accommodations and adaptations, the original creative computing curriculum was revised and reorganized to make it accessible for students with ASD. A total of 42 instructional sessions (7 units, each with 6 sessions) were adjusted, and instructional materials were developed. These materials included session schedules, pre-teaching activities, learning objectives, instructional activities, visual handouts, reflection prompts, work evaluation rubrics, teacher notes, and 60 instructional videos, which were uploaded to the project's YouTube channel. The adjusted computing curriculum was implemented at one school for students with ASD, while the original curriculum was used at another school for comparison. Teachers carried out instructional activities, provided visual handouts, guided students through the materials, showed YouTube videos, modeled computing tasks, facilitated reflections, and completed work-evaluation rubrics. Over the course of the project, 57 instructional sessions were implemented.</p> <p><strong>Data and Results: </strong>Data collected included 480 student responses to reflection prompts, 398 computing projects, 304 evaluations of student work by the classroom teachers, and 100 completed classroom observation forms. Additionally, 20 students with ASD were interviewed about their digital games, interactive music projects, and digital stories for annual showcase days to assess their understanding and application of computational thinking concepts (CTCs) and skills. Also, about 18 students took three quizzes in the second year followed by about 11 students took two quizzes in the third and fourth years. Furthermore, a pretest and posttest, each containing 28 multiple-choice questions, were administered at the beginning and end of the project to measure students' comprehension of CTCs.</p> <p>Observations of the implementation showed that the accessible computing curriculum was more effectively implemented ("completed lessons with few or no prompts") compared to the original curriculum. Classroom teachers&rsquo; evaluations of students' work on the accessible curriculum indicated that students generally completed tasks with either physical assistance or visual/virtual cues. Pretest and posttest results revealed that both groups had similar initial knowledge of CTCs, and the implementation of either curriculum did not significantly impact students' learning of CTCs. Analysis of 170 computing projects created by students using the accessible curriculum, and 231 projects by students using the original curriculum showed that the accessible curriculum was significantly better at improving students' understanding of flow control, while the original curriculum was better for data representation, user interactivity, and logic. Trend analysis of the projects showed that both curriculums were effective in gradually improving students' knowledge and application of CTCs over time. Interviews conducted on computing projects revealed no significant differences between the two curricula in improving computational thinking practices (CTPs) by the second project year. However, by the fourth year, the accessible curriculum was found to be more effective at enhancing students' fluency in CTPs overall. Based on the analysis of the five quizzes that students took throughout the project, the accessible curriculum did not show a significant impact over the original one.
