<AbstractNarration>Hunter-gatherers are thought to live in small groups with no formal leaders. However, recent research indicates that hunter-gatherers in the past had a variety of forms of leadership and ways of organizing themselves. Within this broader context this project will use the scale and pace of earthen mound building at a site in Mississippi as a proxy for understanding the extent of leadership required to construct labor intensive monuments. The monumental landscape presents an ideal case study for hunter-gatherer socio-political organization, and specifically the relationships between leadership, planning, mound building, and the Native histories that led to the remarkable Poverty Point phenomenon. The Jaketown site is a registered National Historic Place and learning more about the social organization of the extraordinary Poverty Point culture and the monuments they left behind will add to the already significant heritage value of the site. Furthermore, the research team is committed to collaborating with the Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes in generating and sharing knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will excavate three mounds. Using standard archaeological methods augmented with geoarchaeological approaches, they will recover stratigraphic evidence and artifacts, including material for radiocarbon dating, that will allow them to explore how quickly these mounds were built, and if they were built at the same time. If the mounds were built quickly and simultaneously it suggests planning and leadership. Building multiple mounds quickly requires effort and coordination that that surpasses the capability of a household; some person or persons need to mobilize the labor, direct the work, and ensure resources were available to workers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>I conducted four research expeditions at the Jaketown site in west-central Mississippi. Jaketown is an important site for understanding the Poverty Point culture of the Lower Mississippi Valley during the period of ca. 4500-3000 years ago. Jaketown also has the most earthworks of any Poverty Point-affiliated site other than the type site in Louisiana. There have been 15 mounds documented at Jaketown, including at least three Late Archaic period (ca. 5000-3000 years ago) constructions. Furthermore, the artifacts documented at Jaketown shows a high degree of similarity with the type site. These factors combine to make Jaketown a critical site for understanding the historical processes that led to the creation of the Poverty Point site. Extant regional histories situate Poverty Point as a center of innovation that exported material culture, practices, and cultural identity to presumably contemporary sites in the region. The data generated by my research contradict this model. We processed 11 new AMS 14C samples, adding to the existing 22, and I created a high-resolution chronological model of site occupation at Jaketown. The model, combined with artifacts, geoarchaeological, and paleoethnobotanical data, demonstrate that some practices considered to originate at Poverty Point, such as mound building and the importation of nonlocal lithics, occurred first at Jaketown.
