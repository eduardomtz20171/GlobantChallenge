<AbstractNarration>This award from the NSF Chemistry Division supports Professor Bhuvnesh Bharti and Professor Kalliat T. Valsaraj of Louisiana State University to study micro/nanoplastics. Micro/nanoplastics have become very common in the environment because of the gradual aging and weathering of discarded plastic waste. They can move up the food chain and potentially impact both aquatic and terrestrial species. In order to assess the potential health risks of micro/nanoplastics, it is critical to understand how they interact with an aqueous environment. The team studies the effect of sunlight-induced oxidation and aging of micro/nanoplastics which increases their wettability and ability to disperse in water. This project is exploratory with risk but the knowledge gained helps guide future in-depth studies of the environmental transport and fate of microplastics. The project provides opportunities for graduate students to develop new skills in an emerging field and actively engages undergraduate students from Baton Rouge Community College in the proposed research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project addresses the question: Do micro/nanoplastics exist as micro or nanosized particles or do they aggregate into larger structures? This question is critical because any biological, environmental, and atmospheric impact of the micro/nanoplastics will be governed by their dispersed/aggregated state. Photooxidation processes lead to the formation of hydrophilic chemical functional groups on the surface of a degrading polymer, which increases the water wettability and dispersibility of the micro/nanoplastics. The team investigates the effect of photooxidation and solvent pH/ionic strength on the dispersibility of spherical shaped model micro/nanoplastics made from polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. These model plastics are photooxidized under controlled laboratory conditions and characterized for their dispersed state using a combination of small angle scattering, light microscopy, and spectroscopic techniques. This is important for understanding the potential of micro/nanoplastics to be transported into the atmosphere by incorporation into aqueous aerosol droplets such as fog, smog, and mist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences program in the Division of Chemistry at NSF investigated the impact of simulated sunlight irradiation on the wettability, dispersibility, and pollutant interactions of aging plastic particles. Microplastics, which are small fragments of plastic typically ranging from nanometers to several millimeters in size, have been detected in a wide variety of environments, including oceans, rivers, deserts, mountains, and polar regions. These particles pose significant risks to both the environment and human health due to their ability to be ingested by marine organisms, potentially entering the food chain and transporting harmful pollutants such as heavy metals and organic toxins. Within the scope of this proposal, the team conducted lab-scale experiments using polyethylene (PE) microparticles as a model system, given PE's prevalence in the environment. They subjected these particles to simulated sunlight using a xenon arc lamp and found that over time, sunlight exposure increased the hydrophilicity of the initially hydrophobic particles.
