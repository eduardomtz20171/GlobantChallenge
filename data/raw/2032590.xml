<AbstractNarration>2032590 (Timko). With support from the CBET/ENG Environmental Sustainability program and the NSF 2026 Fund Program in the Office of Integrated Activities, Professors Michael Timko and Aaron Deskins at Worchester Polytechnic Institute, and Professor Klais Schmift-Rohr at Brandeis University are engaging in a research project that is targeted to elucidate the structure of N-hydrochars and provide a rational basis for design of N-hydrochars for specific applications. N-hydrochars are nitrogen-bearing carbon-rich materials formed by hydrothermal treatment of wastes, such as food waste, livestock manure, and sewage sludge. N-hydrochars are potentially useful for many applications, including as soil amendments, adsorbents, and catalysts. Project success will help to advance toward the goal of the NSF2026 Idea Machine winning entry of a "World without Waste."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A current challenge to the use of N-hydrochars is their complex and unknown structure. NMR of isotopically labeled N-hydrochars synthesized from well- defined precursors will be used to identify and quantify N-hydrochar structural sub-units. The project team anticipates that these sub-units will be furans, arenes, and possibly N-bearing heterocycles, with alkyl linkers decorated with amine and carboxylate side chains. Quantum chemical calculations will be used to simulate the vibrations of these sub-units, enabling development of a Raman method that can be used for N-hydrochar characterization. More complex hydrochars will then be synthesized from food waste. Heavy metal sorption isotherms will be measured on model and complex hydrochars. Quantum chemical calculations will be performed using the previously identified N- hydrochar sub-units and these results will be used first to rationalize measured trends and then refined to provide predictive capabilities to generalize results to different types of N-hydrochars and for sorption of different metal cations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

Examples of lack of clean water include many areas in rural America, especially ones which rely on wells, and some urbanized areas, especially those with aging infrastructure. The aim of this project was to understand the mechanisms and design of a renewable adsorbent for removing toxic heavy metals from drinking water. The renewable adsorbent studied in this project is termed hydrochar. It can be produced from many types of waste, including food waste, agricultural residues, and sewage sludge. The process used to convert these wastes into hydrochar is called hydrothermal carbonization. Hydrochar properties can be tailored to a particular application - including drinking water purification - based on selection of the feedstock and tuning of the conversion conditions. Unfortunately, this process has proven to be a trial-and-error search, largely because the structure of hydrochar is incompletely known. Accordingly, the first objective of this project was to elucidate the structure of hydrochar. We selected several model systems to study, as these structures are simple enough for detailed characterization and yet similar enough to more complex hydrochars as to be useful. Structures of hydrochar made out of glucose and a glucose-glycine mixture were studies. Glucose is a good model compound for biomass. Glucose-glycine is a model for food waste. Molecularly-detailed structures of these two hydrochars were determined using advanced methods based on nuclear magnetic resonance. These structures were then used to understand heavy metal adsorption. Tests were performed primarily on the glucose hydrochar, as well as on a commercial hydrochar donated by industry and produced from sewage sludge. Copper and lead were used as model heavy metal cations. Then, the experimentally confirmed structures were used to simulate cation-hydrochar adsorption energies, which was then used to guide development of isotherm models required for design of water purification processes. Similarly, the molecular structures were used to guide analysis of another important characteristic of adsorbents - surface area. As a rule, materials with more surface area will have greater ability to purify water. This is called adsorption capacity. Interestingly, the surface area of hydrochars has proven impossible to measure accurately. Part of this project was therefore aimed at understanding how to measure the surface area of hydrochar and one of the main outcomes of the study is a set of recommendations that the community can use. The study funded one PhD student who has graduated and is now working in industry. A second PhD student has made steady progress toward graduation. Two MS students graduated; both are now in PhD programs. Many undergraduate students received training on projects. The research team shared its knowledge with SoMax Circular Solutions, a Pennsylvania based startup commercializing hydrochar derived from sewage sludge. More recently, the team opened up communication with CapyBara Energy, a startup that uses carbon-based materials for community scale grid storage. Two papers were published in the peer-reviewed literature and a series of presentations were made at technical conferences. More publications are planned for the near term future. In short, this work provides an intellectual basis for converting waste materials into renewable adsorbents that can provide clean drinking water in many locations, including rural America and inner cities.</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 12/18/2024<br> Modified by: Michael&nbsp;T&nbsp;Timko</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
