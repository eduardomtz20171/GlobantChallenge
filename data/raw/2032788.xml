<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of an alternative methodology to enhance flavor sensations of food and beverages while reducing the consumption of excessive condiments such as salt.  Although it is recommended that a typical American consumes less than 2300 mg of sodium per day to maintain a healthy eating pattern, the average consumption is 3500 mg per day.  Most of the sodium consumed is in the form of salt, and excess sodium intake increases the blood pressure and risk for heart disease and stroke. It is also increasingly evident that the taste function of older adults and cognitively impaired patients diminishes significantly. This leads these groups to consume even higher amounts of salt as a flavor enhancer.  The proposed technology stimulates these sensations to simulate taste.  Potential applications include novel eating and drinking utensils such as a spoon, chopsticks, and beverage tumbler that aim to promote a healthier lifestyle by replacing or reducing unnecessary condiments such as salt. Patients on special diets (e.g., restricted use of salt in sodium-reduced diets) and the elderly (suffering diminished taste perceptions) may use this technology to enhance their taste sensations virtually, making their meals more enjoyable while reducing potential side-effects.  Furthermore, this technology may have applications to treat medical conditions such as xerostomia and swallowing disorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps project is based on the development of an “electric taste” technology that electronically simulates primary taste sensations, such as sour, salty, and bitter. It applies controlled electrical pulses to the tip of the tongue using pure silver electrodes; by controlling the frequency and the amplitude of current, it simulates different taste sensations. These utensils are embedded with electronics and silver electrodes and overlay virtual taste sensations when a user’s tongue is in contact with the silver electrodes.  This enables people to experience digitally augmented taste sensations while eating and drinking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  With the support of NSF I-CORPS, we have conducted a series of customer discovery interviews and sessions to explore applications of "electric taste" technology. "Electric taste" technology utilizes controlled electrical pulses applied to the tongue via pure silver electrodes to simulate primary taste sensations like sour, salty, and bitter. This innovation aims to develop smart flavor-enhancing utensils, such as a salty spoon (FlaVR Spoon), to enhance flavor perceptions without additional chemicals or condiments. Targeting patients on restricted diets and older adults with diminished taste perceptions, our technology seeks to make meals more enjoyable and mitigate side effects like malnutrition or overconsumption of condiments such as salt. The project's objectives include designing a consumer prototype for testing with seniors while exploring the commercial potential of a spoon device that enhances tastes digitally. Key values of the product include delivering adjustable flavor enhancement and reducing reliance on potentially harmful additives in food and beverages.   During this work, we have attended multiple exhibitions, trade shows, and other medical technology-related conferences to conduct these customer discovery sessions.   Main Hypotheses:   1. Reduced salt intake is crucial for the aging population, with limited options to maintain interest in food.   2. FlaVR technology can expedite product development and food and beverage manufacturing testing by optimizing flavor formulations.   3. Electric taste technology can streamline taste panel testing processes, reducing time and cost.   Customer Segments Identified:   1. Older adults living at home or in care facilities who are on restricted diets.   2. Patients recovering from head and neck cancer and experiencing taste loss.   3. Hypertensive patients requiring salt reduction.   4. Internal flavor formulation and taste panel testing in food development.   Key Discussions:   1. Potential for FlaVR technology in formulation settings and QA processes.   2. Opportunities for streamlining taste panel testing.   3. Exploration of pilot studies and commercial partnerships.   4. Importance of reduced salt intake in aging populations.   5. Potential applications of FlaVR technology in addressing taste loss and enhancing food interest.   6. Regulatory considerations and distribution channels in the US and worldwide.      Throughout these events, common themes of addressing dietary concerns, optimizing product development processes, and navigating regulatory landscapes emerged, underscoring the importance of continued exploration and collaboration to realize FlaVR technology's full potential in revolutionizing the food, beverage, and healthcare industries.
