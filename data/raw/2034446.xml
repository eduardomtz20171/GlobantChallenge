<AbstractNarration>The research project is aimed at understanding how the N-protein of the SARS-CoV-2 performs its essential functions in viral infection and transmission. Elucidating the structure and properties of N-protein can open novel avenues of drug design to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and add new tools to the repertoire of anti-viral therapeutic strategies. The broader impact plan is to inform and educate the younger generation about the science of virus transmission and prevention using social media activities such as Skype a Scientist and TikTok videos.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The viral genome nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N plays critical roles in multiple processes of the infection cycle: N-protein protects and packages viral RNA in nucleocapsid assembly, interacts with the inner domain of spike protein in virion assembly, binds to structural membrane protein M during virion packaging and maturation, and binds to proteases causing replication of infective virus particles. The goals of the project are to determine the structure and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 N protein using high resolution techniques such as NMR, identify structural features of viral packaging using protein:RNA cross linking and bioinformatic analyses, and determine the effect of phosphorylation of N on its structure, its interactions with other proteins and its role as an RNA chaperone. This comprehensive approach to N-protein structure-function will enable development of innovative methods to block SARS-CoV-2 at different stages of its life cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This EAGER award is made by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
