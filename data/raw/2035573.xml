<AbstractNarration>Increased global demand for plastic products in recent decades has greatly increased the amount of plastic waste entering the environment. Most plastics are persistent and will enter the environment at the end of their life cycle if not recycled or reused. Up to 94% of manufactured plastics end up in landfills or in the environment. In the environment, large plastic materials can be broken down through physical and chemical processes into small particles (0.1 to 5 mm).  These microplastics can persist in the environment for long periods of time where they can fundamentally change how organisms interact with each other and with their physical environment. These changes can, in turn, change how microplastics move between ecosystems, and their fate in the environment. This has drawn the attention of scientists and environmental managers around the world. The goals of this project are to advance understanding of how ecosystems and communities of organisms respond to the presence of microplastics, and to provide information in support of better management of plastic pollution and problems arising from it. Moreover, this project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with research and career training in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This project will also provide opportunities for talented low-income high school students to participate in research and gain an understanding of the potential environmental impacts of plastic pollution, thus, enhancing a sense of environmental stewardship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will employ innovative designs and approaches developed based on observations and results of previous research to address two main objectives and test four detailed hypotheses. Objectives include, 1) characterize the movement of microplastics across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and 2) characterize the influence of algal colonization and biofilm development on microplastics surfaces on particle deposition rate, zooplankton feeding behavior and selectivity, phytoplankton community structure, primary productivity, and nutrient availability in freshwater systems. Hypotheses include, 1) deposition rates of suspended microplastics ingested and egested by aquatic organisms will be faster than natural abiotic depositional processes; 2) microplastics are transferred from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems via emerging aquatic insects ingested by birds; 3) algal colonization and biofilm development on microplastic surfaces will increase deposition rates of suspended microplastics, alter phytoplankton community structure and primary productivity, and decrease nutrient availability in freshwater ecosystems; 4) in the presence of biofilm-covered microplastics, zooplankton will change feeding locations to areas of high concentrations of biofilm-covered microplastics and selectively feeding on them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

We found no evidence of algal colonization on the surface of microplastics, the vast majority of which settled out of the water column within 3 weeks.&nbsp; No significant differences among treatments were detected in phytoplankton cell density, chlorophyll <em>a </em>concentration, primary production or nutrient concentrations.

With respect to the first objective, we collected samples of sediments, water, aquatic macroinvertebrate larvae and winged adult aquatic insects from urban, suburban and rural sites in Wisconsin and Minnesota, as well as the guts of nestling tree swallows from nesting boxes in proximity to each site and analyzed them for the presence of microplastics. Aerial adult aquatic insects, which metamorphose from aquatic larvae, provide an important food source for nestlings of insectivorous birds. Microplastics, mostly fibers, were detected in all samples (Figure 2), providing evidence of the transfer of microplastics from aquatic to terrestrial systems via the consumption of aerial aquatic insects by adult tree swallows.   To address the influence of microplastics on freshwater aquatic ecosystems and if algal colonization of microplastic surfaces affects rates of particle deposition, we established phytoplankton communities in 350L aquaria (Figure 3), allowing them to develop for 134 days. We tracked changes in phytoplankton cell densities, species composition, chlorophyll a concentration (algal biomass), primary productivity and nutrient concentrations in the water over the course of 8 weeks in the absence of microplastics (control) and after adding either low (0.1 mg/L) or high (100 mg/L) densities of manufactured polyethylene microspheres (125-150 um in diameter). We found no evidence of algal colonization on the surface of microplastics, the vast majority of which settled out of the water column within 3 weeks. No significant differences among treatments were detected in phytoplankton cell density, chlorophyll a concentration, primary production or nutrient concentrations. However, the species composition of phytoplankton communities exposed to microplastics diverged from that in control aquaria after 6 weeks (Figure 4), suggesting varied response among algal species to indirect and long-term exposure to this type of microplastic. This result warrants further investigation.   To determine the affect of zooplankton activity on plastic microsphere deposition rate and the effects of microplastics on behavior and localization of zooplankton, we conducted two experiments employing individuals from laboratory cultures of the zooplankton species, Daphnia magna. In the first, microsphere deposition rates in aquaria were quantified over the course of 96 hours in the presence and absence of D. magna. Microsphere deposition was significantly greater in the presence of D. magna, indicating zooplankton swimming and feeding activity accelerates microplastic deposition (Figure 5). The second experiment was conducted in a photarium, which allows the movement between, and time spent in, different depth zones within the test chamber in the presence or absence of microplastics to be quantified. In test chambers containing microplastics, the microspheres settled to the bottom of the chamber before individual zooplankton were introduced. In those conditions, D. magna spent nearly all their time during test runs at the bottom of the chamber in proximity to microspheres. In the absence of microplastics, D. magna moved throughout the test chamber displaying no preference of any depth zone (Figure 6).   We also conducted an experiment to monitor the behavior of two species of zooplanktivorous fish in the absence of Daphnia magna or microplastics (control) and in the presence of D. magna alone, microplastics alone or both D. magna and microplastics. Results suggested that when D. magna and/or microplastics are present, fish moved toward the area where D. magna and microplastics were most abundant, reflecting both a natural predator-prey relationship and the possibility that microplastics are perceived as prey.    Through this funding, 3 graduate students and 5 undergraduate students have gained research experience. Two of the graduate students successfully defended their thesis and earned their Master of Science in Environmental Science and Sustainability from Loyola University of Chicago. The third, at Auburn University, moved on to pursue a Ph.D. at another institution before finishing the MS degree.
