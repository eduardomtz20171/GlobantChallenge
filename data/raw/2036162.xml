<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will improve infection control in public transportation.  There is currently no high-speed, autonomous method capable of decontaminating commercial aircraft and public transit vehicles. The proposed technology rapidly inactivates viruses and other potential biothreats in an automated robotic disinfection system.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This SBIR Phase I project proposes development and scaling of a system using radiofrequency (RF) directed energy to activate a benign chemical, producing biocidal reactive oxygen on surfaces.  Preliminary studies of MS2 bacteriophage viruses have demonstrated inactivation of 99.999999% of MS2, despite being 7-10x more difficult to inactivate than SARS-CoV-2. The proposed system consists of four subsystems: application sprayer, RF, robotics, and power. This project will optimize and integrate these subsystems. A key technical objective is identifying the power density threshold and appropriate frequency for virus inactivation without negative interactions with electronic equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  In 2021, Zeteo Tech, Inc. was awarded $256,000 for a project titled Automated Robotic Disinfection System (COVID-19). This effort applied the companys electromagnetically catalyzed decontamination system (EMCAT) to the challenge of decontaminating commercial passenger aircraft contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. This system uses microwave energy to activate the chemistry of benign, safe chemical compounds to deactivate viruses. Zeteo Tech, Inc. demonstrated the ability of the EMCAT system to deactivate viruses. Zeteo Tech, Inc. designed a prototype robotic disinfection system that could rapidly decontaminate a commercial aircraft between flights to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The system comprised four subsystems: one for the application sprayer, one for the microwave energy, one for the robotics, and one for the power. Zeteo Tech, Inc. demonstrated these subsystems. During the progress of the global pandemic, it became clear that SARS-CoV-2 was not stable on surfaces, and the business case for this robotic decontamination system was weak. Zeteo Tech, Inc. received permission to pivot from virus decontamination to elimination of insect vectors of disease.   Zeteo Tech, Inc. focused on eliminating the deer tick Ixodes scapularis. The deer tick is the carrier of Lyme Disease, which has profound health effects. The Centers for Disease Control received reports of 63,000 new cases of Lyme Disease in 2022 from state and District of Columbia health departments. Zeteo Tech, Inc. demonstrated that our EMCAT system selectively resonated ticks and kills adults with a 30-second microwave exposure. Zeteo Tech, Inc. is developing a business plan for this tick-killing technical approach.        Last Modified: 10/22/2024       Submitted by: ThomasPMccreery]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
