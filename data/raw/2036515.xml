<AbstractNarration>CERF's Rising TIDES (Toward an Inclusive, Diverse, and Enriched Society) workshop will support broader, cross-cutting efforts by the NSF to increase participation in STEM by under-represented minority (URM) individuals. Support of this workshop strengthens CERFâ€™s commitment to and capacity in broadening participation, including participation in an NSF INCLUDES Alliance and additional URM activities. Through this workshop, CERF will leverage other NSF-funded programs, specifically the INCLUDES SEAS Islands Alliance and IUSE:GEOPAths C-StREAM projects. The proposed morning workshop session will be dedicated to building and strengthening relationships between underrepresented student scholars (URSS) and professional and near-peer mentors, inspiring URSS participants to see themselves as science professionals and part of the CERF and coastal and estuarine science and management community, and providing URSS with tools useful to achieve their career goals. The afternoon workshop session will train participants on addressing implicit bias in their academic and professional settings; the session will be open to all CERF conference attendees (with 50 anticipated workshop attendees). The afternoon workshop develops diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) champions who can return to home institutions with additional DEI skills. Efforts begun at the workshops will be scaled up throughout the conference through various structured activities involving student and professional participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadening participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is widely recognized as critical to the science and engineering enterprise. There is still a wide gap in U.S. STEM educational attainment between URM individuals and whites and Asians, and coastal and estuarine science faces similar gaps in URM representation. In recognition of this gap and to incorporate fundamental change in the way the CERF community supports and addresses the individual needs of all members, CERF seeks to support diversity and inclusion efforts at its 2021 Biennial Conference. Specifically, these efforts include: (1) enhance URSS professional development, including cohort building, mentoring, and participation in a URSS-focused workshop, scientific sessions, and other conference and post-conference activities; (2) build the capacity of CERF to achieve DEI objectives through a workshop open to all attendees, and through additional learning opportunities throughout the conference; and (3) ensure broad engagement of the CERF community by infusing DEI throughout the conference. Evaluation of the workshop and broader conference DEI efforts will improve future Rising TIDES actions and provide transferrable lessons for similar DEI conference programming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Increasing participation of marginalized and minoritized groups in STEM is essential to sustaining the nation's capacity for innovation and discovery. However, despite decades of effort, there is still a wide gap in STEM educational attainment for students from underrepresented groups and that gap is even wider in ocean sciences. These trends have disturbing implications for the nation's coastlines where, on average, communities have increased social vulnerability and are more racially diverse than non-coastal areas. Thus, there is a disconnect between the diversity of individuals studying, managing, and protecting these systems and the people who live there, and coastal community members are not fully engaged in co-creating solutions to the challenges and opportunities they face.</p> <p>The Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation (CERF) is a professional society committed to advancing understanding and wise stewardship of estuaries and coasts. Since 2017, with NSF support, CERF has hosted the Rising TIDES (Toward an Inclusive, Diverse, and Enriched Society) Conference Program (RTCP), which supports students from backgrounds underrepresented in CERF disciplines to attend the biennial conference and encourage them to pursue careers in coastal and estuarine science and management. Students are provided with full financial support, mentorship, peer support, networking, professional development activities, and access to the full suite of conference activities, including the opportunity to present their research if they choose. While the 26th&nbsp;Biennial CERF Conference was held virtually, we were still able to achieve our goals, including:</p> <ul> <li>supporting 48 students, 17 near-peer mentors (advanced graduate students or early career professionals), and 15 professional mentors to participate in the 2021 RTCP (80 total participants);</li> <li>implementing a new group mentorship pod model (vs a dyadic mentor:mentee pair) to enhance student support; </li> <li>engaging eight RTCP alums to serve as near-peer mentors and to assist with organizing and implementing RTCP, thus providing them with a leadership opportunity; </li> <li>providing RTCP participants with five virtual training and networking events intended to increase their sense of belonging, build their professional skills, and improve their mentorship relationships;</li> <li>supporting 13 RTCP students and near-peer mentors to attend a regional Affiliate Society meeting; </li> <li>providing conference attendees and the broader coastal and estuarine science and management community with opportunities to learn about and reflect on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in our disciplines through workshops and webinars; and</li> <li>raising awareness of issues surrounding DEI within the coastal and estuarine science community and encouraging culture change within and outside of CERF. </li> </ul> <p>Program evaluation found the overwhelming majority of student respondents were satisfied with their experience (64% were very satisfied, 32% were satisfied). The mentoring component was highlighted as one of the most valuable aspects of the RTCP with most student respondents rating their mentor and near-peer mentor as extremely helpful. The pod experience (i.e., mentoring groups vs. traditional dyads) offered a new way to cultivate mentorship relationships but will need additional work for it to be more effective. Surveys of CERF 2021 attendees demonstrated relatively low awareness of CERF DEI strategies, with the greatest awareness being of keynote and plenary speakers from diverse racial, ethnic, and social identities. However, for those aware of the strategies, they were considered by many of the respondents to be important for their own commitment to the DEI work. Several people shared ways they are using new skills or information back at their home institutions to increase diversity and be more inclusive.</p> <p>Professional societies play a critical role in DEI and culture change in their respective disciplines. Through our experience with Rising TIDES and due to strong leadership, CERF has pushed forward tremendously in our fundamental understanding of DEI, structural and systemic barriers that continue to lead to persistent low recruitment and retention of professionals from underrepresented backgrounds in coastal and estuarine science and management, practices that may help remove or lower barriers and promote culture change, and the importance of authentic community engagement, particularly given the vulnerability of and local knowledge held by many historically-marginalized coastal communities we serve. It has greatly increased our capacity to implement this work within CERF and the broader community through increased learning, training, and collaboration, and has fully engaged CERF leadership in these efforts. CERF has made and continues to make significant changes to policies, practices, programs, and procedures within our organization that have been largely driven by knowledge gained through Rising TIDES and the partnerships and collaborations it has led to. Examples include a new mission, vision, and values statements that explicitly incorporate DEI; a new strategic plan that explicitly states "promoting and supporting equity and justice" as a goal but also aspires to incorporate DEI into all the work we do; and new policies and procedures to make volunteer experiences, nominations and selections for award recipients and leadership positions more transparent, equitable, and inclusive.</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 05/16/2024<br> Modified by: Susan&nbsp;Park</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2036515/2036515_10706502_1715880817713_2021RTCPCollage_v2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2036515/2036515_10706502_1715880817713_2021RTCPCollage_v2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Collage of 2021 Rising TIDES participants"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2036515/2036515_10706502_1715880817713_2021RTCPCollage_v2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Collage of 2021 Rising TIDES participants"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A collage of headshots of 2021 Rising TIDES students, near-peer mentors, professional mentors, and organizers.
