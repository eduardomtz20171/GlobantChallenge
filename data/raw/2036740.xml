<AbstractNarration>Award Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 2036740 &amp; 2036915&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Yuhao Zhang and Han Wang (co-PI)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative Research: ECCS-EPSRC: Nitride Super-Junction HEMTs for Robust, Efficient, Fast Power Switching&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Lead) and University of Southern California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Power semiconductor devices are regularly utilized as solid-state switches in power electronic systems that are widely used in consumer electronics, data centers, electric vehicles, electricity grid, and renewable energy systems. The global power device market exceeds $15 billion in 2019 and is fast growing. Gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) are commonly perceived as the next generation of power devices. Despite their initial commercialization recently, their wide adoption in industrial applications is hindered by the limitation in reliability and robustness, resulting in considerable over design, rendering device performance far below the material limit. This project will develop a new generation of robust, charge-balanced GaN HEMTs through innovation in the semiconductor materials and device structure. Interdisciplinary research will be carried out in materials, devices, fabrication processes, and circuit-level tests through collaboration between Virginia Tech and the University of Southern California in the United States, as well as University of Cambridge in United Kingdom under the “NSF Engineering - UKRI Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Lead Agency Opportunity (ENG-EPSRC)”. This US-UK collaborative project provides opportunities for student education and international exchange, development of cross-university teaching modules, and industrial collaboration for potential technology transfer. This interdisciplinary, cross-continent project also involves outreach activities for K-12 students and teachers, and promotes educational activities related to microelectronics and power electronics technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This overarching hypothesis is that robust gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) can be implemented by selective-area, nearly defect-free embedding of p-type regions into the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel, forming a novel charge-balanced super-junction structure. This novel 2D-3D super-junction structure can not only enhance the device robustness by managing the electric field and avalanche capability, but also allow significantly higher 2DEG density while maintaining the normally-off operation, thereby decreasing the device specific on-resistance and boosting its switching frequency. Despite these promises, major gaps exist in the device physics of the novel super-junction, interfacial material properties, and the dynamic performance of super-junction HEMTs in power electronic circuits. Funded by the “NSF Engineering - UKRI Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Lead Agency Opportunity (ENG-EPSRC)”, this project aims to address the scientific knowledge gaps in four relevant areas through the US-UK research collaboration: (a) to explore the design space and performance limits of the novel super-junction HEMT device; (b) to probe new methods of selectively introducing p-type dopants into the 2DEG channel to realize the super-junction functionality; (c) to develop an in-depth understanding of the dopant profiles, carrier transport, and trap dynamics in the nitride super-junction structure; and (d) to correlate the nano/mesoscale materials and interface properties with the dynamic characteristics and robustness of GaN HEMTs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Gallium nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are widely utilized for power electronics applications in mobile electronics, data centers, and electric vehicles. The current market size of GaN power devices have exceeded $1 billion and is fast growing. However, the performance of current GaN HEMTs is far below the material limit. The overarching hypothesis of this project that a new generation of GaN power devices with significant performance leap can be realized through innovation of materials and device structures, highlighting the utilization of charge-balanced structures that comprises p-type materials to pair with n-type drift region to improve the electric field modulation. These charge-balanced structures can enable the electrostatics in an additional geometrical dimension as compared to the direction of current flow and re-write the performance limit of GaN power devices. This three-year project has explored the design space, performance limits, fabrication technologies, as well as the material and circuit characterizations of such charge-balanced structure in GaN. This project builds on a collaboration between Virginia Tech and University of Southern California in the US and the University of Cambridge in the UK.</p> <p>The first device platform that the team investigated was the multi-channel AlGaN/GaN device, which vertically stacks multiple two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channels in a lateral device to reduce the sheet resistance and enhance the current capacity. However, the electric field management is a pressing challenge due to the high volume charge densities (i.e., net donors present after the 2DEGs are depleted). The address this challenge, the team proposed a p-GaN Reduced Surface Field (RESURF) structure with its acceptor charges precisely balancing the net donor charges in the multi-channel. Building on this charge-balanced multi-channel platform, the team demonstrated high-voltage GaN power diodes with breakdown voltage exceeding 10 kV and specific on-resistance of 39 m&#8486;&#8729;cm<sup>2</sup> (Fig. 1). These devices are not only among the highest voltage GaN devices; their specific on-resistance is at least 2.5-fold lower than the best 10 kV diodes that have been previously reported. In addition to power diodes, the team also demonstrated a multi-channel, charge-balance GaN HEMT up to 10 kV, which also leverages a monolithic cascode structure to realize the normally-off operation (Fig. 2). This 10 kV GaN HEMT also achieved 2.5-fold lower specific on-resistance than the best 10 kV power transistor that had been reported in all materials.</p> <p>The second device platform that the team investigated was the vertical GaN superjunction device, which comprises alternative p-type and n-type regions with charge balance in a vertical drift region. The three groups, together with additional collaborators, demonstrated the first vertical superjunction device in GaN (Fig. 3). The team used the p-type nickel oxide (NiO) to form the charge-balance structure with GaN, where NiO is sputtered conformally in 6 &micro;m deep n-GaN trenches. Vertical GaN superjunction p-n diodes were fabricated and show a breakdown voltage of 1100 V and a specific on-resistance of 0.15 m&Omega;&#903;cm<sup>2</sup>. The <em>R</em><sub>ON,SP</sub>~<em>BV</em> trade-off exceeds the 1-D GaN limit, fulfilling the superjunction functionality in GaN. Later, the team developed a novel self-aligned process for the fabrication of such heterogeneous superjunction, which relaxes the need for demanding lithography and can be applicable to heterogeneous superjunction based on various material systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The above research has produced 14 publications in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings, as well as one patent application. As a highlight of the publications, the three PIs of this project published a review/perspective paper in Nature Electronics, in which they proposed the concept of multidimensional power devices and systematically discussed their performance limits, design space, and development roadmaps (Fig. 4). Another two papers have been selected in the Technical Highlight of IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) and covered by Nature Electronics. In addition, in this project, the three teams graduated four PhD students in the US and UK, with one from the underrepresented group. The three teams also developed teaching materials collaboratively and gave short courses in several conferences.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 06/15/2024<br> Modified by: Yuhao&nbsp;Zhang</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2036740/2036740_10715403_1718460962154_Picture4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2036740/2036740_10715403_1718460962154_Picture4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Multidimensional devices can break the performance limit of power devices."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2036740/2036740_10715403_1718460962154_Picture4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Multidimensional devices can break the performance limit of power devices."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Multidimensional devices can break the power capacity versus switching frequency trade-off of conventional power devices.
