<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[In the Arctic, research vessels play a critical role in exploration and continue to contribute significantly to the US research effort. Shipboard research provides a means to understand physical and biological processes upon which human well-being depends. NSF provides shipboard marine technical support in the Arctic to satisfy two main functional requirements of NSF through the Ship-based Technical Support in the Arctic (STARC) award: (1) to plan, coordinate and deliver scientific technical support onboard US Coast Guard Cutter (USCGC) Healy (and other vessels and platforms, as appropriate) in a manner that augments the role of the US Coast Guard (USCG) marine science technicians, and (2) to coordinate with NSF, USCG and the academic community to provide for the operation, maintenance and upgrade of science equipment installed or used on USCGC Healy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;STARC shipboard technical support enables transformative scientific research by providing competent shipboard technical services that enable the effective use of oceanographic facilities by scientists and students. Marine technicians assist researchers in the safe and appropriate use of oceanographic instrumentation, which improves both the quantity and quality of oceanographic researct1 conducted. Our marine technicians participate in ongoing educational programs to maintain operational readiness, learn new skills, and continually improve the methods for executing research at sea. By seeking out and sharing new ways to better achieve scientific objectives at sea, marine technicians strengthen, broaden and perpetuate the capabilities of NSF-supported oceanographic research infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The awardee will employ an approach based on best practices within the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS). A senior technician will be designated Arctic Cruise Coordinator with the responsibility for creating and maintaining a cruise planning process suited to meet the needs of scientists embarking on USCG icebreakers operating in the Arctic region. As cruises are identified for the upcoming field season, the Coordinator will work with scientists, NSF and USCG personnel to coordinate and execute the required technical and logistical activities for each cruise leg. The Coordinator will develop staffing schedules for each deployment, as well as pre- and post-deployment activities and off-season maintenance. Under the supervision of the Project PI, the Coordinator will develop annual budgets and annual reports that will be submitted to NSF. The spectrum of research enabled by this technical support collectively achieves far-reaching broader impacts through the promotion of training and learning, increased participation of underrepresented groups in research, and dissemination of results that enhance scientific and technological understanding. STARC technicians train and educate US Coast Guard technicians, and share new tools and techniques with colleagues throughout the UNOLS fleet, thus broadening the technical knowledge base that supports U.S. oceanographic research. These technical services support the acquisition and broad dissemination of shipboard data to ensure that shipboard data is submitted to US national data centers in a timely manner, thus enabling data to be made broadly available to the academic community and the public at large.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

This award supported a collaboration between the Shipboard Technical Support (STS) department at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and the Marine Technician Group (MTG) at Oregon State University (OSU) to provide the highest level of shipboard technical support possible using a model for arctic shipboard technical support that follows University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) best practices.
