<AbstractNarration>This project lies at the intersection of several fields of mathematics: representation theory, classical and quantum integrable systems, mathematical physics, and enumerative algebraic geometry. While the former three branches originate from quantum physics, the last one deals with applications of purely algebraic concepts to geometry. Representation theory concerns the study of symmetries of a vector space such as three-dimensional Euclidean space (more generally, an infinite dimensional space) with additional structures. These symmetries can be often thought of as algebraic structures such as groups, Lie algebras, or associative algebras. Two cases are of particular interest: (1) the case of sufficiently many pair-wise commuting symmetries, which is a primary subject of study in integrable systems, and (2) the case when the underlying vector spaces arise via generalized cohomology theories associated with geometric moduli spaces. This project aims at resolving several open questions pertaining to those cases through the study of shifted quantum groups; the first surprising connections of those novel algebras to Toda-like quantum (difference) integrable systems and quantized Coulomb branches were discovered in the recent work of the PI.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The major theme of the proposed research is the study of shifted quantum affine algebras and the corresponding new structures on the quantized Coulomb branches. The project is broken down into five parts, as follows. The first part will investigate integral forms of shifted quantum affine algebras. One objective is to show that they map surjectively onto quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branches and to describe explicitly the kernel of these maps using the shuffle approach. Another important structure to be constructed on such integral forms are coproduct homomorphisms: these will descend to the truncated counterparts, thus quantizing multiplications of the corresponding classical K-theoretic Coulomb branches. The second and the third parts of the project are aimed at the construction and study of monoidal categorification of the quantum cluster algebra structure on quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branches via shifted quantum affine algebras, and a construction of new vertex operator algebras via shifted affine Yangians of gl(n). The fourth part deals with a novel approach to Lax matrices via antidominantly shifted quantum groups. This will bring new insights into now relatively old subject of the inverse scattering method. At the same time, it will also emphasize an overlooked importance of antidominant shifts, leading to a new study of Bethe subalgebras of the quantized Coulomb branches. This work will also provide a systematic construction of Baxter Q-operators, implying functional and TQ-relations for them. The fifth part of the project aims to obtain Kazhdan-Lusztig type character formulas for finite-dimensional representations of DeConcini-Kac truncated shifted quantum affine algebras at roots of unity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
