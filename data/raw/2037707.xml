<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[The development of high-performance batteries is vital for applications such as electric vehicles, portable electronics, and storage of electrical energy from renewable sources. Although lithium-based batteries are currently used in many high-performance applications, batteries based on more earth-abundant materials such as potassium and sodium are being investigated as more sustainable alternatives. In this project the investigators are seeking to prepare the next generation of organic-based electrode materials for potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) using an advanced class of crystalline porous polymers called covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The electrode materials will help improve the performance of KIBs and assist with reducing the accumulation of harmful greenhouse gases emitted from fossil fuels. The principal investigator is utilizing several education and outreach programs at Ohio State to help increase the participation of young underrepresented minorities in STEM fields. These activities include participation in the Breakfast of Science Champions, an OSU STEM program that allows underrepresented middle school students from Columbus City Schools the opportunity to visit and learn more about various cutting-edge research projects at OSU. The investigator is also co-directing and mentoring students in the OSU Chemistry and Biochemistry Post-Baccalaureate Bridge Program, an OSU STEM program that provides assistance to post-baccalaureate minority students to help enable their success in a Ph.D. program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator is developing conductive two-dimensional (2D) COF-based anode materials that contain triangular-shaped pi-electron conjugated dehydrobenzoannulenes (DBAs) for KIBs. COFs possess high chemical stability and open pore channels, making them useful for the transport of ions; however, the transport processes of potassium within these structures are poorly understood and will be studied this exploratory work.  Although conductive inorganic materials (e.g., Sn, P, Sb, and Bi) have been developed for KIBs, many of these materials exhibit volume expansion, which can compromise the structural integrity and cycling stability of the system. Olefin linkages are useful on account of their enhanced chemical stability and ability to extend pi-conjugation along the x and y planes of 2D polymeric materials. DBAs are neutral macrocycles that are redox-active and capable of using their peripheral aromatic rings and soft alkynyl ligands to form strong pi-cation interactions with potassium ions. These features will be useful for fabricating organic-based electrodes for KIBs with superior electrochemical properties and good cycling performance. The PI will also study several non-aqueous electrolytes that will minimize side reactions and potassium dendrite growth.  Results from this exploratory project may be transformative in leading to the design of lightweight olefin-linked COF-based electrodes that can be used as components of highly efficient KIBs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>
