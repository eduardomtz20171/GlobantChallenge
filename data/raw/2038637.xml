<AbstractNarration>This research improves our understanding of the risk perceptions that people have regarding techna hazards (i.e., a natural disaster triggered by technology) with a focus on earthquakes in Oklahoma. Earthquakes are a relatively new phenomenon in Oklahoma, and have become increasingly common since 2008. Residents lack experience dealing with this type of hazard and do not know how to protect themselves or their property in the event of an earthquake. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be information for emergency managers to develop plans and campaigns to help residents adjust to earthquakes , taking into account the special needs associated with different demographic groups. The project supports education and promotes diversity through outreach activities aimed at recruiting and retaining under-represented students in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the fundamental understanding of risk in relation to disasters that blur the line between natural and technological. It provides emergency managers with key information they can use to encourage local households to adopt hazard adjustment measures. It builds upon existing hazard adjustment theories and a recent pilot study to address five research objectives: 1) to understand Oklahomans' view of earthquakes, risk perceptions, and levels of adjustment in different earthquake risk zones, 2) to investigate differences in household earthquake hazard adjustment levels across different demographic groups, 3) to understand household views of earthquake triggers (endogenous vs. exogenous), 4) to discover ways researchers can increase their mail survey response rate, and 5) to develop a theory that better describes how households adjust to hazards. By capturing household perceptions of earthquake hazard risks, origins, and implications, along with their understanding of their ability and responsibility to address these threats, this project provides a critical complement to technical assessments of these events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>
