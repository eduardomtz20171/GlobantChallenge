<AbstractNarration>This grant addresses the need for improved fundamental understanding of the manufacturing of flexible printed electronics.  Flexible printed electronics has tremendous potential for a spectrum of exciting products in fields spanning health care, robotics, security and distributed sensing. However, the growth in the field has been limited by the lack of roll-to-roll manufacturing processes that are efficient, reliable and produce high-performance electronic circuits.  This grant carries out research on the manufacturing fundamentals needed by the field overall and for a specific roll-to-roll additive manufacturing platform called Self-Aligned Capillarity-Assisted Lithography for Electronics, or SCALE.  SCALE combines two industrially established technologies, imprint lithography and inkjet printing, to achieve a high-throughput manufacturing platform for printed electronic devices with smaller feature sizes and layer-to-layer alignment of electronic materials needed for high-performance flexible electronic circuits.  The research will contribute fundamental knowledge in electronics, fluid mechanics, materials development and manufacturing processes, impacting not only the printed electronics research community and industry, but also multiple fields and industrial sectors, such as microfluidics, conformal optics, soft robotics, and distributed sensing. The research team brings together expertise in electronic materials and devices, manufacturing, fluid mechanics and modeling.  The research involves graduate students as well as K-12 students and industry through outreach events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports fundamental research to overcome formidable challenges facing the flexible printed electronics field, including integration of multiple materials, creation of streamlined manufacturing processes, and achievement of the high-performance requirements of modern electronics.  Using the SCALE platform, the team will conduct research to understand and predict the capillary flow and solidification of electronic inks, develop new electronic device designs, improve roll-to-roll manufacturing processes, and explore the connections between processing, materials and mechanical performance of flexible electronic devices.  One important goal is the fabrication of devices capable of high-frequency operation, which demands precise control of the size, distribution and thickness of electronic materials. The research includes both computational modeling of ink flow and material distribution as well as innovative designs and experiments that elucidate the process fundamentals and the performance of the resulting devices and circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Electronic devices that are integrated into flexible plastic sheets are in high demand. Applications driving this demand include health diagnostics patches that conform to the skin, displays that roll up for storage, and sensor arrays that can be placed in critical locations on infrastructure such as aircraft wings. The realization of flexible electronics for these and many more applications requires a reliable, low-cost manufacturing method. High efficiency manufacturing methods, such as roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing, that incorporate additive processing methods, such as printing, have great promise due to their efficient use of electronically functional materials, low waste, and scalable production. The goal of this research project was to advance the manufacturing fundamentals needed to drive the development of additive R2R processes for flexible electronics with an emphasis on the self-aligned capillarity assisted lithography for electronics (SCALE) process. In SCALE, electronically functional liquid inks are ink jet printed onto plastic substrates that are engineered with patterns of ink receiving reservoirs and capillary channels with feature sizes on the order of 1-100 microns. Ink is printed into reservoirs and is then drawn by capillary action into the much smaller channels, much like a liquid is drawn into a paper towel. By careful structuring of the reservoirs and channels, electronic devices are constructed by sequentially printing and drying different functional inks into the reservoirs and subsequent capillary action. A precision process called micro-imprinting is used to make the multilevel pattern of reservoirs and channels on the flexible substrate such that the different inks self-align into electronic components, such as resistors and capacitors, after printing and drying.   Several significant advances were made in this research project. First, we expanded our predictive mathematical model for capillary flow in open rectangular reservoirs to include complex free-surface morphologies, solvent evaporation, surface tension driven-flows due to gradients in solute concentration and temperature, and finite-size reservoir effects. Model predictions compared well with experimental results. Moreover, we explored the role of capillary channel wettability differences between the bottom and side walls on control of ink flow. Second, we designed the structure and processing conditions for a diode composed of a complex materials stack. Using the fundamentals of drying and diffusion, we developed the means to control the materials distribution and produce a high-performance device. A lubrication-theory-based model was also developed to predict material distribution in drying inks.  Third, we developed a new design for resistors and produced devices at high yield and with tunable resistance based on device geometry and ink selection. Moreover, multicomponent circuits that incorporated combinations of diodes, capacitors and resistors were also created. Fourth, we demonstrated enhanced printing precision with a multinozzle inkjet printhead incorporated into an R2R printing line and developed an automated method for testing the effect of repeated mechanical flexing on device performance.   For broader impact, this research project has been essential in the education and career preparation of five graduate students and two undergraduate students. Results have been widely disseminated to the scientific and industrial communities through publications and presentations, and the research has had broad impact on the fields of flexible electronics, printing process and R2R manufacturing fundamentals, fluid mechanics and microfluidics.
