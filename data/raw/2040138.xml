<AbstractNarration>This award supports the participation of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral students at the Annual National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChE) conference, held Sept. 24-25, 2020. The 2020 NOBCChE conference is in a virtual format in 2020 due to disruptions from COVID-19. Selected participants are from underrepresented minority groups in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields. In addition to providing registration support for students, this award enables the development of a robust online platform for participant engagement. This is funded by Divisions of Chemistry and Materials Research, both of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biological Science Directorate, and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, and Transport Systems as well as the Division of Industrial Innovation and Partnerships, both of the Engineering Directorate. The Principle Investigator is Godfrey Murrell of the University of Mississippi. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides opportunities for participants to engage in four major areas of focus: 1) STEM technical and professional development; 2) networking and mentorship opportunities with STEM professionals; 3) exposure to prestigious minority role models in STEM; and 4) STEM career advancement opportunities. Student participants interact with peers and professionals from industry, government, and academia to develop collaborations and to explore opportunities to pursue graduate degrees in the chemistry, chemical engineering and related disciplines. This is accomplished through a virtual conference. These opportunities not only impact these specific participating individuals, but also benefit the larger community of STEM field practitioners as these activities are useful in recruiting and retaining individuals from underrepresented talent pools. NOBCChE seeks to increase the number of minorities in the STEM workforce. The compression of the typical weeklong NOBCChE conference to two days is augmented by post conference access to various materials. Assessment plans enable the comparison of prior in person NOBCChE events to this first ever virtual event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Accomplishments   * What are the major goals of the project?   The mission of NOBCChE is to build an eminent cadre of people of color in science and technology. NOBCChE fulfills part of its mission through local, regional, national and global programs that assist the membership in fully realizing their capabilities and potential in academic, professional, and entrepreneurial pursuits in chemistry, chemical engineering, and STEM-related fields. The NOBCChE Annual Conferences brought together, in one setting, underrepresented minority-serving institutions (HBCUs and HSIs), Majority (Research) Institutions, key federal agencies, and industries committed to increasing the number of underrepresented minorities, including women and those with disabilities, representation in chemistry, chemical engineering, and STEM-related careers. In particular, the 2020 NOBCChE conference focused on creating a pathway to STEM careers by identifying and sponsoring 200 underrepresented minority students, including women and persons with disabilities in chemistry, chemical engineering, and related STEM fields to attend the conference virtually.      The meeting was designed to provide young researchers a platform to present research and receive feedback (ConneXions Poster Session), showcase the research of scientist regarded as experts in their respective fields (Master Scientist Sessions), and provide a space for discussion to foster partnership and collaboration that can lead to new research, innovations, and solutions to global challenges (DuPont GOLD Competition).   * What was accomplished under these goals (you must provide information for at least one of the 4 categories below)?   Major Activities:   Over two days NOBCChE delivered:  DuPont Gold Seminar featuring talks by more than a dozen student researchers Held a Poster Reception in which more than 130 students presented their work Presented the Master Scientist Sessions featuring the Percy Julian and Winifred Burks-Houck Lectures. Held more than 20 post-conference talks.    Specific Objectives:  To have more than 200 underrepresented students participate in learning, speaking and discussions during the virtual conference and post-conference activities To present more than 50 training and professional development opportunities Assess the impact of the virtual conference on the sense of community among the students.    Significant Results:  A total of 420 minority students participated in the virtual conference and the post-conference activities including 282 graduate and 112 undergraduate students. 54 percent were female. 53 workshops, talks and other professional development training opportunities were presented.   Students were thoroughly engaged in the conference sessions and contents of the virtual experience. Several students expressed a heightened interest in NOBCChE and being a part of the community. More information on student outcomes for the conference (webinars and on-demand sessions) is in the attached external evaluation report.       Key outcomes or Other achievements:   What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?  A total of 53 training and professional development opportunities were provided before, during and after the virtual conference, including;    o Master Scientist Talks (Percy Julian, Winfred Burks-Houck, Joseph Cannon and Lloyd Ferguson)   o Student Development workshops on such topics as resume building, interview skills, negotiating, wealth building, choosing your research home, exploring opportunities, scholarships and more   o Forensics Panel   o Monthly workshops by the Academic Collaborative   o Panels by NSF and AAAS   o Covid-19 Panel   o DuPont Gold Seminar   o Pfizer Organic Seminar   53 training and professional development opportunities were offered. Additionally, the bulk of these presentations also will be available on NOBCChEs Youtube channel in the future.   * How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?   The results of the 2020 virtual conference have been disseminated to targeted communities through the NOBCChE email Listserv, NOBCChE Ebrief, and NOBCChE website.   * What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?   NOBCChE was able to complete goals in the area of recruitment, presentation, and providing a space for discussion to foster partnership and collaboration that can lead to new research, innovations, and solutions to global challenges.
