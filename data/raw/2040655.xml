<AbstractNarration>In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, social unrest, financial and other crises, it is important to understand the impacts of such events on higher education. In particular, close attention must be paid to the impact these events have on underrepresented minority (URM) faculty representation in engineering, already of grave concern before the pandemic. This work aims to ensure that their voices are heard and reflected in policy change impacting their career trajectories. This project will utilize a holistic approach to gathering data from URM engineering faculty, especially women, from a variety of institution types, (e.g. Hispanic Serving Institutions, Predominately White Institutions, and Historically Black Colleges &amp; Universities). The voices of these faculty will be used to inform policy makers in academia of multiple aspects of the convergence of multiple crises on the professional outcomes for URM engineering faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will be at the forefront of research investigating policy development and implementation related to URM engineering faculty sustainability and advancement. It aims to inform systematic, long-term and doable plans addressing potential further disruption and/or lasting change in the Academy. This project will be accomplished by (1) collecting data of the lived experiences during these crises and sharing URM engineering faculty insights about the impact to their personal lives and professional careers; (2) building a dataset of interim and current university policies related to themes determined from data collection/analysis; (3) using the data to inform policy change and to energize current initiatives to support retention of URM engineering faculty and (4) hosting a virtual colloquium for collaboration and sharing of best practices among university faculty and leaders for supporting and strengthening efforts for broadening participation in engineering. This research will reveal how interim and/or new policies and practices during and after a crisis can impact the career trajectories of URM engineering faculty.  This work is urgent given the fact that the number of URMs seeking terminal degrees in engineering and the number of URM engineering faculty has flat-lined.  This study will provide recommendations for procedure and policy revisions/augmentation for universities aimed at ensuring faculty success during and after current and emergent crises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Responses of Universities to Crisis Impact and Implications on Underrepresented Minority Engineering Faculty study addressed the need for researchers to capture and understand in-the-moment lived experiences of underrepresented minority engineering faculty members during the convergence of multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the social unrest prompted by the George Floyds murder, and the economic state of the US institutions of higher education. Historically, underrepresented minority faculty members face a range of impediments to achieving success in academia. These impediments often stem from implicit bias and structural barriers, creating a challenging environment. As attention during a crisis is devoted to reactively finding solutions to address the immediate challenges faced by faculty, the overarching goal of this project was to collect data to ensure that the voices of underrepresented minority engineering faculty members were heard and reflected in policy change impacting their career trajectories and to inform university administration/policy of project outcomes to consider when revising/creating equitable policies for broadening participation in engineering, during times of crisis and beyond. The project used a mixed-method approach, which included a survey and a formal semi-structured interview.   Quantitative data was analyzed using frequency counts, ANOVA, and t-tests. From the survey data analysis, we found that universities put interim policies in place that addressed short-term (immediate to 1 year) concerns/challenges. Still, not many put in place measures that would consider the long-term (beyond one year) implications of the crises on faculty careers and professional well-being. Qualitative data was analyzed using an inductive approach, interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Findings suggested that URM faculty felt pressured to be invisible and not acknowledge racial tensions, felt hyper-visible, and lost trust/faith in their institutions.    One of our dissemination products was a virtual colloquium. During this colloquium, four URM engineering faculty at varying career stages, from assistant professors to full professors/administrators from multiple institution types across the US, shared their experiences during these crises and provided insights about their impact on their personal lives and professional careers. These faculty specifically shared their experiences and how the crises impacted their career regarding teaching, research, and service, the pillars for promotion and tenure. Overall, the project allowed researchers to learn from the unique perspectives of URM faculty and determine the impact of the crises on support received during the crises.Data from this project continues to be analyzed. Outcomes will be shared with appropriate stakeholders through publications and presentations at national conferences to ensure that the conversation regarding crisis impact continues and considers the perspective and unique challenges faced by underrepresented minority engineering faculty.
