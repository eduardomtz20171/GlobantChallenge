<AbstractNarration>This project aims to investigate a central object in modern algebraic combinatorics: a class of cluster algebras. These cluster algebras are related to a wide variety of other mathematical objects arising in algebraic geometry, representation theory, and other areas, but are also important in particle physics, where they are related to scattering amplitudes in certain quantum field theories. Hence a better understanding of cluster algebras is not only interesting in its own right, but also has significant potential application in other areas of mathematics and beyond. The project will provide training for students through involvement in the research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rigid modules, invariant curves, and knots are fundamental objects in many branches of mathematics. This project takes a cluster-algebraic approach to studying these objects. The research goal, largely motivated by homological mirror symmetry, is to study invariants for indecomposable modules over hereditary algebras, for quiver Grassmannians, and for alternating knots. The project aims to develop new combinatorial and geometric objects to reveal more concrete relationships between cluster algebras and other areas of mathematics. The educational goal of this project is to train undergraduate and graduate students in topics at the intersection of algebra, combinatorics, geometry, topology, and representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Here we report two major outcomes.      (1) It is an open problem to find cell decompositions of quiver Grassmannians associated to each cluster variable. We initiate a new approach to this problem by giving an explicit description for each individual subrepresentation. We illustrate our approach for the Kronecker quiver. This is joint wirk with Ulysess Alvarez.      (2) There have been several combinatorial constructions of universally positive bases in cluster algebras, and these same combinatorial objects play a crucial role in the known proofs of the famous positivity conjecture for cluster algebras. The greedy basis was constructed in rank2by Lee-Li-Zelevinsky using compatible pairs on Dyck paths. The theta basis, introduced by Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich, has elements expressed as a sum over broken lines on scattering diagrams. It was shown by Cheung-Gross-Muller-Musiker-Rupel-Stella-Williams that these bases coincide in rank2via algebraic methods, and they posed the open problem of giving a combinatorial proof by constructing a (weighted) bijection between compatible pairs and broken lines. We construct a quantum-weighted bijection between compatible pairs and broken lines for the quantum Kronecker cluster algebras. By specializing the quantum parameter, this handles the problem of Cheung et al. for skew-symmetric cluster algebras of finite and affine type. For cluster monomials in skew-symmetric rank-2cluster algebras, we construct a quantum-weighted bijection between positive compatible pairs (which comprise almost all compatible pairs) and broken lines of negative angular momentum. This is joint work with Amanda Burcroff.      Broader Impacts : The first project was a joint work with a postdoc, and the second one was a joint work with a graduate student. These projects give them training opportunities.     Last Modified: 09/14/2024       Submitted by: KyungyongLee]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
