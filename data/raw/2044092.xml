<AbstractNarration>Eyewitness identification has long played an important role in criminal investigations and prosecutions, where identifying the culprit is critical to the criminal justice process. Based on advances in understanding of perception and memory, this project will examine the role of “fillers” in lineups. Fillers are the individuals in a lineup known to be innocent who serve to challenge eyewitness recognition. The research will develop a novel method for filler selection based on a combination of human and machine measures of facial similarity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds upon a new paradigm for the design and conduct of lineups for eyewitness identification. Drawing upon perceptual scaling, well-established in sensory psychology, this approach will be used to estimate the strength of eyewitness memories, and thus to generate large libraries of facial images in which the degree of facial similarity is quantified. This research will help to reduce susceptibility of the eyewitness to decision bias and will provide quantitative measures of the perceived similarity of faces. These measures, in combination with a machine learning algorithm, will be used to create a model witness, which is an algorithm that reproduces similarity judgements of human observers and predicts perceptual similarity for new faces. The project will yield an objective system for selecting fillers in order to optimize eyewitness fairness and performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Eyewitness identification has long played a valued role in criminal investigation and prosecution. Evidence indicates, however, that eyewitnesses sometimes identify innocent suspects, with tragic personal and societal consequences. Post-conviction DNA analyses reveal that thousands of innocent person-years have been spent behind bars, the overwhelming majority of these quashed lives being men of color. At the same time, the modern sciences of human information processing have yielded enormous gains in our understanding of the aptitudes and weaknesses of perception, memory, and decision-making. Much recent research has focused on conditions of lineup composition that might improve eyewitness performance.   Traditionally, an eyewitness lineup is composed of one suspect and a set of lineup participants known to be innocent. These fillers serve as lures to challenge recognition memory. The choice of fillers markedly affects the probability that an eyewitness will correctly identify the perpetrator and not misidentify an innocent suspect. Lineups composed of fillers of roughly the same degree of similarity to a witness description of the perpetrator are termed fair. Conversely, lineups composed of fillers that possess differing degrees of similarity to the perpetrator are termed unfair or biased.   In this project, we developed a novel approach to filler selection, called Model Witness, based on a combination of human and machine measures of facial similarity. Drawing upon perceptual scaling, in combination with a machine-learning algorithm that predicts perceptual similarity for new faces, this approach can be used to generate large libraries of facial images in which the degree of facial similarity is quantified. This is an objective system for selecting fillers in order to optimize eyewitness fairness and performance. Because it allows for rapid identification of perceptual similarity distances between all pairs of faces in an arbitrary face library, we anticipate that this approach will greatly facilitate selection of fair lineups.   In summary, conviction of innocent people who have been misidentified by one or more eyewitnesses has been a pervasive problem with tragic personal and societal consequences. Here we have shown how concepts and techniques from longstanding academic disciplines of experimental psychology and computational science can help mitigate the problem.
