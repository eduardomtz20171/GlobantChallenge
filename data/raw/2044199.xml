<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest by recognizing and highlighting undergraduate teaching excellence in the fields of engineering and engineering technology (EET). There have been calls for more than 100 years for faculty members in these fields to receive ongoing training in how best to teach their students. However, for a variety of reasons, there have been relatively few attempts to answer this call within the US. There are isolated opportunities for training through a variety of organizations or through campus-level efforts, but none is close to rising to a national-level response. When students are not taught and do not learn in an effective and efficient manner, some choose to leave EET altogether during college, while others may be less well-prepared for their initial employment. What is needed, therefore, is a national effort to create a framework that helps EET faculty in the US identify and receive recognition for training that helps them continually improve their teaching. Through this project, the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) will undertake the development of a framework for national recognition of faculty professional development within EET in the US. This effort to establish a cadre of effective EET faculty across the nation seeks a long-term outcome to increase the retention rate of students within EET and to provide better-prepared technical workers for industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work focuses on the development of a framework for national peer-recognition of training and continuing professional development of EET instructors. The goal is to increase the value of these efforts by extending the definition of professionalism to include EET education faculty activities. The current effort will be informed by the literature and utilize a theory of action proposed by Kotter and co-workers.  The main efforts within this proposal will be to develop a national framework for EET faculty recognition of teaching that will focus on levels of attainment and proposed activities to meet these levels. Input from a variety of constituencies (administrators, faculty and content developers) within ASEE will be sought via focus groups and surveys to inform the proposed framework and associated activities. The results of this proposal will help to formulate the next steps to engage with constituencies outside of ASEE. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      In the United States, students in the field engineering and engineering technology are taught by professionals and technical experts in their area. However, it has long been understood that the act of teaching requires both knowledge of the particular area of study and knowledge of how to effectively convey the information to students. It is this latter point  conveying the information in an effective manner  that has never been adequately addressed in the US, especially in the areas of engineering and engineering technology (EET). The efforts in this work have started a process to attempt to address this overlooked area.      In this Capacity Building grant, we engaged (via surveys, focus groups, and town halls) a wide variety of American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) constituencies, which include various divisions (e.g., Faculty Development, Minorities in Engineering, etc.), groups (e.g., Engineering Deans Council, Undergraduate Associate Deans Committee, Dept. Chairs), and sections (e.g., Illinois-Indiana) for their thoughts and opinions on the value of a system that recognizes professional development in teaching. The approach was that if individual faculty (and their supervisors  Dept. Chairs and Deans) in EET recognize and value professional development in the area of teaching, training in this area in the future would become the expectation in the field.  This is important, as it would be expected that (with training) the quality of teaching would increase and a variety of benefits would be realized (e.g., increased academic retention, increased progression through degree programs, enhanced workplace performance, etc.)      As the ideas in this Capacity Building grant would have broad impacts, we classified the work as a structural change. We started with a general idea of a recognition system at the outset based on what exists elsewhere in the world and evolved to a three-tiered framework based on the extensive feedback obtained in this work. The tiers of the framework (see supporting image) now include a Registered Engineering Educator Level (REE), a Certified Engineering Educator Level (CEE), and a Leading Engineering Educator Level (LEE). The first level, REE, focuses on passive training based on a list of competencies to be obtained and hours associated with each competency. The second level, CEE, provides the individual an opportunity to demonstrate implementation of the competencies learned. The final level, LEE, recognizes efforts to expand the impact of engineering education and training outside of an existing classroom setting.      The framework would need to be both recognized nationally and managed in that way. Thus, ASEE is the lead organization for such an effort as it is the recognized national organization for education in engineering and engineering technology. Feedback obtained throughout the work efforts in this grant from the variety of constituencies engaged have served to underscore this point.
