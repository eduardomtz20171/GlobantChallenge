<AbstractNarration>This project aims to serve the national interest in undergraduate STEM education by investigating the learning and experiences of undergraduate students in virtual mechanical and aerospace engineering laboratories. The COVID-19 pandemic has ignited multiple crises in student lives, including sudden changes in living situations, decrease in study hours, lower academic performance, lost internships/jobs, and lowered income expectation.  At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic places new emphasis on the potential benefits of remote learning arrangements including online virtual labs in engineering. However, although these virtual engineering labs may be intended to increase student access to learning, these labs may also perpetuate climates and cultures of inequality. The project will investigate the design of a virtual lab framework intended to promote equity and inclusion for all students, in particular those who are underrepresented in engineering. The project team will examine how students engage with, learn from, and adapt to new virtual lab tools and how these tools affect studentsâ€™ motivation to learn and their self-identification with engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on three aims: (i) the design of a validated educational instrument for assessment of learning in virtual labs; (ii) the investigation of online-learning technologies and the conditions that lead to improved teaching and learning; and (iii) faculty professional development. The research component of the project will examine how the language, gender, race, and class of people appearing in a virtual lab affect the level of student comfort and participation in virtual lab activities in senior capstone labs. The research design includes a sequential exploratory mixed method approach, undergirded by appropriate theoretical models (Technology Acceptance Model and Inputs-Environment-Outcome Conceptual Model). It is expected that results of this work will inform virtual lab designers about environmental inputs that resonate across genders and diverse student populations. Findings will be disseminated via publications, presentations, and learning modules to engineering, engineering education, and educational research audiences. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

In higher education, the majority of VL research has focused on case studies of implementation, design, and development of VLs for physical sciences and engineering disciplines. These prior studies primarily examined UG students as a monolithic group often masking the perceptions and experiences of students traditionally marginalized in engineering, e.g., women, African American/Black, Latine,&rsquo; Native American, and LGBTQ+. The variability in methods and techniques for evaluation of VL impact on student learning and outcomes from these prior studies have been mixed, where it is difficult to compare findings between engineering laboratories in a systematic and rigorous way.</p> <p>This project has addressed the gap in the literature by establishing a novel and student-centered assessment instrument called the Student Perceived Value in Engineering Lab (SPVEL) tool. This assessment instrument establishes the foundation for holistically evaluating the effectiveness of engineering education labs by meaningfully connecting student and instructor learning goals, student sociocultural identities, and laboratory mechanisms for communication. The SPVEL assessment instrument (validated for in-person and virtual/remote engineering laboratory environments) examines how students perceive and value engineering laboratories according to instructor defined learning goals for content mastery; and student defined professional and academic skill development, enhanced association/affinity for the engineering profession, and motivation to learn and assign time for learning course materials. It also introduces aspects of personalized learning assessment by allowing students to critically reflect on the design and execution of engineering labs and relates their viewpoints to sociocultural identity (race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status) and prior formal/informal knowledge (access to educational engineering laboratory tools and work experiences), which influence how and what motivates them to spend time towards learning discipline specific engineering topics. Finally, SPVEL examines the communication (student-to-student and student-to-instructor) in virtual engineering laboratory environments and relates it to how students perceive and value the learning laboratory experience. Prior to this project, few, if any, studies existed that considered these factors when evaluating and designing VLs for engineering communities.</p> <p>To establish this innovative approach, three theoretical frameworks were leveraged: the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Astin&rsquo;s Inputs-Environment-Outputs Conceptual Model, and Engineering Role Identity. By connecting these theoretical models, engineering education researchers, practitioners, educators, and engineering VL designers gain understanding about how students&rsquo; extrinsic motivators, such as perceived usefulness, ease of use and personal characteristics such as ethnicity, background, and gender influence their behaviors with respect to motivation to spend time learning via a VL and/or VL-rated course materials. It also gives these communities insight into how students&rsquo; prior experiences inform educational learning preferences and choices.</p> <p>Findings have been disseminated to engineering and educational research audiences via publications, presentations, and workshops. Work to date suggests that while some marginalized groups in engineering, e.g., Latine&rsquo;/Hispanic and African American/Black have less exposure and experience with virtual STEM educational laboratories, their perceptions of VLs educational value differed that their white and Asian counterparts. For example, Latine&rsquo;/Hispanic UGs believed that VLs could replace some in-person labs (e.g., demonstration-based labs) to a higher extent than other racial/ethnic groups. Also, African American/Black students agreed that VLs are good learning tools to a higher degree than their white and Asian classmates. Students who self-identified as part of the LGBTQ+ community and Latine&rsquo; students identified less with the engineering discipline than other sexuality and race/ethnic groups. Prior experience with VLs were not statistically associated with academic performance (grades), which suggests that VL environments can be tailored to address instances of lack of access to VLs in students&rsquo; previous academic experiences. Paradoxically, women associated higher value to in-person laboratory experiences (in comparison to other genders studied), though their academic performance (measured by laboratory reports and quizzes) were statistically higher in VLs juxtaposed in-person laboratory environments.
