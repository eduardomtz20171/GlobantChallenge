<AbstractNarration>National Science Foundation&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 2048406/2048416                                             PI Name: Shea, Patrick/Bunte, Jonas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal ID: 2048406/2048416&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Houston/University of Texas at Dallas&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Patrick Shea/Jonas Bunte&lt;br/&gt;NSF Program: Security and Preparedness&lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative Research: International Coercion, Debt Relief, and Land Transactions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will determine when governments transfer control over portions of their national territory to pay off loan debts to international creditors. The project will provide systematic evidence on the domestic and international conditions that influence the decisions of governments to exchange land for debt relief. The empirical analyses in the project will be based on a new dataset to be collected on all land transactions between countries related to debt relief. The results of this project will contribute to improving our understanding of when the international debt problems of countries can lead them to make territorial concessions to other countries. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will develop and test theory on the different debt relief strategies that governments can choose to adopt and why land transactions are sometimes selected instead of other available policies such as austerity or default. A new and more comprehensive dataset on land transactions for debt relief will be collected for the period 2000 to 2020. Statistical analyses of the new data set, employing simultaneous equations, will be conducted to test theoretical propositions. The results of the project will advance basic research on the management of international debt, the use of economic leverage by states to gain concession from states on security issues, and the dynamics of international negotiations over territorial concessions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project had two major outcomes. First, the project developed a theoretical framework for governments' responses to indebtedness in the context of international land transactions. Our theoretical approach examines the causes and consequences of land deals with two assumptions. First, we assume that the decision to sell/buy land is one policy option among many to deal with debt. For example, instead of using territory to generate revenue, a leader in a potential selling state can implement austerity or default on debt obligations to free up fiscal resources. Second, we assume that these various policy options produce different winners and losers. Leaders will want their supporters to "win" from these policy choices, or else risk losing power.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The second major outcome is data collection. This occurred in two stages. In the first stage, we verified existing international land transactions from the LandMatrix dataset. The Principal Investigators (PI), along with a group of research assistants, cross-referenced each observation against the resources listed in LandMatrix and conducted independent research to ensure the accuracy and currency of each observation.
