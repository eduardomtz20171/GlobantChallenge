<AbstractNarration>Many countries have promoted increased foreign capital liberalization as a path to economic growth and development. However, little is known about the social consequences of these policies. This research project will study the socio-political and distributional effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) induced by these policy changes.  Using the staggered liberalization of access to foreign capital across several industry groups, the research will attempt to answer the following questions: (1) Does foreign capital liberalization in the manufacturing and/or service sector accelerate the process of changing the structure of economies? (2) What are the social, economic, health, and political, and distributional consequences of foreign capital liberalization policies, especially for vulnerable groups, such as women, racial and other minorities?  The research project will build a large data set disaggregated at local administration level to study these issues.  The results of this research project will guide policies to deal with the possible economic effects of foreign direct investment.  It will also provide guidance on policies to decrease the possible negative social consequences and distributional effects of foreign direct investments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project exploits the staggered liberalization of foreign capital flows to different disaggregated industries at different times to measure the causal average and distributional effects of foreign capital liberalization. This project has two parts: The first part measures the effects on occupational switching, gender attitudes, human capital, and fertility. The second part will measure the effects on social outcomes related to the rise of populism, such as crime, political attitudes, and religious violence. Treatment of industry by foreign capital liberalization is measured by the pre- and post-reform mix of industries in a district. The analysis will then use a local labor market difference-in-differences (diff-in-diff) strategy to compares outcome change in affected and non affected districts from the pre- to post-reform period. The project will build panel datasets that will be harmonized at the district-level to measure the distribution effects of policy changes. This project will provide one of the first causal evidence on the effects of foreign capital liberalization on structural change as well as on a broad range social effects, such as female labor force participation, fertility, and education.  The results of this project will provide guidance on policies to decrease the possible negative social consequences and distributional effects of foreign direct investments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  We have created versions of the Indian National Social Sample Schedules (NSS) 1 and 10 with harmonized district codes and variables, including migration, employment, and educational outcomes from 1994 to 2012. After we have published papers on major goals #1-2, these harmonized data, along with replication files, will be made publicly available to other researchers.      We cleaned the special migration supplement of the NSS (Round 64) and have generated some interesting results related to migration. The preliminary findings suggest that there was a migration response due to our policy.      Using the NSS data, we have also generated some interesting results related to child labor/human capital investment. We find preliminary evidence that greater exposure to the liberalization of both the services and manufacturing sectors reduced enrollment in school for children 5-17.      We have also harmonized the National Family Health Survey as this survey will help generate some of the outcomes of interest related to gender (ie fertility, bargaining power, etc).      We have also generated some of the treatment variables using the Indian census. We use both the fourth (1998) and third (1990) economic census. We harmonized the data on industry classification and districts, and developed a probabilistic matching to convert industry classification of 1987 into the classification of 1998. The districts have been harmonized such that the Indian census can now be merged with the NSS, which should help other researchers in the future to use both these datasets that can be complimentary.
