<AbstractNarration>In December 2019, scientists identified a novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) that was associated with an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China and that was suspected of being zoonotic in origin. Within 3 months, this outbreak was labeled a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and a national emergency was declared in the United States. Over the next year, over 500,000 Americans lost their lives to the disease and millions more became ill. In addition, U.S. residents simultaneously coped with a variety of other cascading collective traumas (an economic recession, race-driven social unrest, weather-related disasters, and a contentious presidential election). In the context of this turbulence, variants of COVID-19 have spread worldwide. Nonetheless, there has been unexpectedly good news regarding the development of safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19, and their rollout across the U.S. has accelerated over time. Understanding how Americans respond to the pandemic and government actions to address the pandemic (e.g., vaccine rollout) is critical information that can guide policymakers as they develop national policies to mitigate its impact on public health and welfare. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2020, in collaboration with NORC at the University of Chicago, the research team studied over 6,500 individuals from the AmeriSpeak panel, a nationally representative probability-based sample of adults across the United States, as they responded to and coped with both personally- and collectively-experienced traumas. Initial data were collected in March and April 2020, at the start of the pandemic in the U.S., and a second wave of data was collected in September and October 2020. The scholars will conduct a third survey of these respondents as vaccinations continue, the pandemic waxes and wanes across the world, and Americans return to a post-pandemic reality. The team will continue to study emotional (fear, worry, distress), cognitive (perceived risk, time perception), and behavioral (health protective behaviors) responses to the pandemic and its associated stressors and examine how early responses to the pandemic and evolving psychological processes have shaped outcomes over time. The research also examines how widespread media coverage of COVID-19 and direct exposures to pandemic-related stressors (e.g., job loss, death of a loved one) are associated with psycho-social responses to the pandemic, and how cognitive and affective processes shape risk assessments, behavioral responses, and mental health outcomes over time. Finally, psycho-social responses are also mapped against neighborhood, county, and state-level parameters (e.g., behavioral restrictions, unemployment rate, COVID-deaths). Limited research has taken a social ecological approach to infectious disease response or examined how community-level factors may affect perceptions of risk of future hazards â€“ especially ones with such uncertain and deadly outcomes. This project examines predictors of variability in response to the COVID-19 crisis, as well as advances future conceptual work on coping with highly stressful national threats. The findings can help policymakers, service providers, members of the media, and educators design risk communication materials and intervention efforts that are evidence-based, cost-effective, and sensitive to the needs of the populace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

We also examined how direct and indirect exposure through widespread media coverage of the COVID-19 outbreak were associated with acute stress responses, the success (or failure) of the media in affording people the information needed to understand the threat, and how cognitive and affective processes shape risk assessments, behavioral responses, and psychological outcomes. Our first wave of data collection was conducted March 18-April 18, 2020, in the very early phase of the pandemic in the U.S.; participation in our early data collection was excellent (we obtained a Wave 1 sample of N=6514, representing a 58.5% participation rate). The&nbsp; second wave of data collection was conducted between September 26-October 16, 2020, after nearly 6 months of this chronic crisis upending daily life in the U.S.&nbsp;In the fall of 2021, funded by the present grant, we completed our third wave of data collection (November 8-24, 2021). Retention was again strong, with a final sample of N=4,881 (75.3% participation rate, retention rate 74.9%). Key findings from the first 18 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. include:</p> <ul> <li>Perceptions about the risk of getting sick from COVID-19 and having severe outcomes if one did fall ill were subject to bias. Almost 44% of our probability-based nationally representative sample demonstrated an optimistic bias early in the pandemic: they did not report higher risk of death from COVID-19 despite having one or more well-known risk factors for poor disease outcomes (e.g., older age, obesity). Six months later, these risk perceptions prospectively predicted engagement in health protective and risky behaviors, as well as vaccine intentions, demonstrating that objective risk of disease severity only inconsistently predicted health protective behaviors.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>During the protracted collective trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic, reports of distorted perceptions of time (e.g., time slowing, days blurring together, uncertainty about the future) were widespread. We found that present focus, blurring weekdays and weekdays together, and uncertainty about the future were common experiences reported by over 65% of a probability-based nationally representative sample six months into the pandemic. Predictors of temporal distortions included pre-pandemic mental health diagnoses, daily pandemic-related media exposure and secondary stress (e.g., school closures, lockdown), financial stress, and lifetime stress and trauma exposure. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>During the early stages of the pandemic, state-level behavioral mitigation policies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 ranged in their degree of stringency and enforcement. Moreover, case and death rates varied considerably across the U.S. When person-level COVID exposures during the first six months of the pandemic (e.g., COVID-19 related illness and loss) were juxtaposed against the relative impacts of COVID-19 state-level restrictions and mitigation policies, we found no relationships among state-level mitigation, cases, or deaths on mental health outcomes (distress, loneliness, traumatic stress symptoms). However, person-level exposures, and in particular having contracted COVID-19 oneself, knowing others who had been sick or died, and exposure to media coverage of the pandemic, were all significantly associated with distress, loneliness, and traumatic stress symptoms. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>The media channels people relied on for COVID-related information at the onset of the pandemic were linked with distress, belief in the seriousness of the threat, and efficacy of mitigation efforts, as well as health- and risk-taking behaviors over time.
