<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site on “Computing for Health and Well-being” is hosted by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Iowa. The site is motivated by the considerable strain on the U.S. healthcare system due to both short-term challenges, such as those posed by the COVID19 outbreak, and long-term trends, such as an aging US population. To tackle these and other health and well-being problems, we must train the next generation of computer scientists to work alongside health professionals as part of interdisciplinary, problem-focused teams. Toward this goal, this project has designed a ten-week program that will inspire students to pursue careers in computer science and related fields through early exposure to high-quality and hands-on research experiences as part of diverse, engaging, and cutting-edge research projects. The primary goal is to provide research experiences to students from institutions that do not have the research infrastructure or interdisciplinary research opportunities available. This project aims to attract students from underrepresented groups (female and minorities) with an emphasis on first-generation students. Our efforts will contribute to preparing a workforce of young scientists who will help maintain America's competitive advantage in science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU participants will (1) learn about interdisciplinary research, (2) apply computational thinking to real-world problems, (3) become familiar with the culture and research methods of different disciplines, and (4) participate in workshops on research methods, scientific communication, and career development, and (5) create their first professional network and build self-confidence in their abilities. Each student will be placed into their mentor’s research group to work on cutting-edge interdisciplinary problems such as disease modeling, personalizing hearing aids, or engaging neurodiverse children through gameplay. Exposure to diverse research projects under the umbrella of computing for health and well-being will further participants’ understanding of their specific project and broaden their appreciation of different research methods. Students will learn through reinforcing interactions with other REU participants, graduate students, domain experts, and mentors. The experiences of tackling socially relevant problems and participating in professional development will provide REU participants with an intellectually challenging and engaging experience, preparing them for their future computer science careers. Working alongside graduate students will provide the participants with insights into graduate student life and encourage participants to consider graduate school. The mentoring received by early-career faculty and graduate students will also significantly impact their future careers, helping to train the next generation of researchers to tackle computational challenges in health and well-being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by Computer and Information Science and Engineering’s Information and Intelligent Systems division and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Outcomes Report: Computing for Health and Well-being     The US healthcare system is under considerable strain due to short-term challenges, such as those posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and long-term trends, such as an aging population. Our goal is to prepare the next generation of computer scientists to work alongside health professionals in interdisciplinary, problem-focused teams to address these and other health and well-being related challenges.     The University of Iowa Computing for Health and Well-being REU program hosted 33 students between 2021 and 2023. Most participants were college sophomores or juniors: 20 (61%) identified as female, 13 (39%) identified as underrepresented minorities, and 20 (61%) were from institutions with limited research opportunities.     The specific objectives of this REU are:      inspire students to pursue careers in STEM through a summer research experience that immerses students in hands-on research projects bringing together computer scientists and health sciences experts;     teach students the research process including how to apply computational thinking through a sequence of workshops and discussions on their projects;     familiarize students with the cultures and research methods of different disciplines;     provide a supportive environment where students receive encouragement from their peers, faculty mentors, and graduate students;     encourage students to pursue graduate studies and increase awareness of their possible career paths.      The evaluations indicate that the REU program was well-received and achieved the planned outcomes. According to focus group data, students consistently reported that their research experiences were rewarding and yielded considerable learning and growth. They also greatly appreciated the support provided by REU mentors and staff and other logistical support offered through the program (e.g., housing and food). Students also appreciated their connections with one another.     Quantitative pre/post program assessments across multiple years showed sizeable gains in research skills, self-efficacy, and leadership (at least half a point on a five-point scale). Students also exhibited somewhat more modest gains in teamwork, attitudes toward computer science, and their intent to pursue graduate education, although we note that the pre-program values on these particular constructs were already high (generally over 4.0), likely due to self-selection bias. In general, students were highly satisfied with most aspects of the program, with scores ranging from 4.4 to 5 on a five-point scale. Students were also quite satisfied with the mentoring they received (all scores were above 4.1 on a five-point scale, with most scores above 4.5).     Sample student comments:     "It let me know that I wanted to be more involved in research opportunities. Since my college does not offer computer science research programs, I would have never known that I wanted to go through this path as part of my future career."     "I cannot understate how helpful it was! My contributions towards my research were generally in the field of software engineering, so it gave me a lot to talk about on my resume! It was a constant point of interest throughout my interviews."     "I was able to develop strong interpersonal relationships both with my peers and my mentor which made me more confident in myself."     Out of the 33 students who participated in the program, 18 are currently pursuing their undergraduate degrees. Two students enrolled in graduate school, and two more intend to apply for graduate programs this year. Over 50% of REU participants maintain ongoing contact with other students from the program. Additionally, many of the students continue to collaborate with faculty mentors after the program concludes. Our students have not only created but also presented posters at either the REU Virtual Symposium (2021) or the UI Summer Undergraduate Research Conference (2022, 2023). You can find posters and post-project descriptions on our website: https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~kleimn/reu/index.html     Intellectual Merit:     This program exposed students to diverse research projects under the umbrella of computing for health and well-being. Students learned how to conduct interdisciplinary research, communicate scientific results effectively, and explore career opportunities through reinforced interactions with other REU participants, graduate students, domain experts, and mentors. By the programs completion, participants had not only gained valuable skills and built connections: they had also developed a more comprehensive and profound understanding of research, graduate life, and professional career paths. This experience boosted their self-confidence and prepared them for future careers in computer science.      Broader Impact:     Our program has demonstrated the ability to effectively involve students from underrepresented minority groups, female students, and students from institutions with limited research opportunities under the computing for health and well-being umbrella. Aside from the direct benefits extended to REU students, our own early-career faculty and graduate students have received valuable training and have become more effectively engaged in mentoring undergraduate students. We believe programs like this REU are instrumental in preparing the next generation of researchers who will address the important and timely computational challenges across the health sciences and in the realm of personal wellness.
