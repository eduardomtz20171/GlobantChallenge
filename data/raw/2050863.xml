<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;This REU-Site project provides high-quality, hands-on experience in materials research to a diverse group of ten undergraduates with interest in the sciences and engineering. During the summer, student participants spend 10 weeks at the Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter (LRSM) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The targeted student participants are gender, racially, and ethnically diverse, representing a broad spectrum of colleges throughout the nation including community colleges, minority-serving institutions, and those with limited research opportunities. During their time at Penn, students are introduced to materials research as a cohesive subject of study. Students are active participants in research groups of faculty affiliated with the LRSM, receiving authentic research and mentoring experiences similar to those of graduate students in the same groups. Beyond their own research group, students engage with each other socially, participate in numerous professional development workshops and activities, and learn about other fields of research to understand different career paths they could consider. Altogether, the experience helps strengthen the science and engineering pipeline by training, mentoring, and supporting young researchers while simultaneously contributing to state-of-the-art research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;This REU-Site project provides high-quality, hands-on experience in materials research to a diverse group of ten undergraduates with interest in the sciences and engineering. During the summer, student participants spend 10 weeks at the Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter (LRSM) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The targeted student participants are gender, racially, and ethnically diverse, representing a broad spectrum of colleges throughout the nation including community colleges, minority-serving institutions, and those with limited research opportunities. During their time at Penn, students are introduced to materials research as a cohesive subject of study. Students are active participants in research groups of faculty affiliated with the LRSM, receiving access to state-of-the-art facilities to conduct authentic research and mentoring experiences similar to those of graduate students in the same groups. Depending on their interests and educational background, REU research activities can range from synthesizing new polymers, to probing the optical properties of quantum dots, to measuring mechanical responses of soft materials such as colloids and emulsions, to computing electronic band structures of topological insulators and yet-to-be-synthesized composite materials. To extend their research experience, students participate in a weekly research seminar to absorb front-line materials science and engineering and learn to present their research findings both orally and in a written report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This three-year program, hosted by the Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter (LRSM) at the University of Pennsylvania, offered an opportunity for 30 undergraduate students, ranging from freshmen to non-graduating seniors, to undertake an independent research project in an interdisciplinary materials group under the direction of a leading scientist. The program promoted students with diverse experiences and perspectives, which is evident in the cohort statistics: 49% of the students were Pell Grant recipients, 17% were the first generation in their families to go to college, 89% from under-represented groups, 57% under-represented minorities, 60% female, 14% with disability, and 2% veterans. Students were provided a hands-on authentic research experience and given extensive training in effective oral communication skills development with a focus on educating younger audiences with less background knowledge. The undergraduate students presented their research findings separately to visiting high school students and to their peers. For professional development opportunities, students participated in weekly seminars from Penn faculty and engaged in a variety of workshops ranging from <em>Societal Ethics and Implications of Scientific Research</em>, to <em>Effective Methods of Scientific Communication</em>, to<em> Applying to Graduate School</em>.</p>  <p>The breadth of materials topics covered in the LRSM research portfolio allows students from different disciplines to interact and appreciate the application of materials research to engineering, medicine, industry, and commerce. Overall, the stimulating intellectual environment provided by this program resulted in positive evaluations across areas including engaging in real-world scientific inquiry, growth and confidence in communication &amp; research skills, and guidance in choosing future career paths. Of the REU students who have completed their undergraduate degrees, 87% have entered graduate school in STEM programs or medical school, with the remainder going to industry and other sectors. This program, therefore, demonstrably contributes to the nation&rsquo;s technology base and the well-being of society at large.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 12/20/2024<br> Modified by:
