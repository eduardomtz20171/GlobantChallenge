<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Program at the University of North Texas will enhance the knowledge and research skills of a diverse cohort of undergraduate students through empowering, innovative, and interdisciplinary research experiences in developing Deep Learning applications and systems. The program aims to 1) expose undergraduate students to real-world and cutting-edge research focused on accelerated deep learning through combined hardware and software development; 2) encourage more undergraduate students to continue their academic careers and seek graduate degrees in computer science, computer engineering, and related disciplines; 3) develop research skills and improve communication and collaborative skills in undergraduate students. The emphasis of this program is on the interdisciplinary research experience for the REU students to gain hardware-software codesign skills. REU students will be mentored by experienced researchers in the area of AI/machine learning algorithms, computer system and architecture, biomedical informatics and computational life science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ten students will be hosted on the University of North Texas campus each summer where they closely collaborate with faculty and graduate students in performing innovative research that will address the timely and critical problems in developing Deep Learning systems and algorithms. Through their projects, the students will be able to observe the connections and interactions between different disciplines involving hardware and software. The REU students will also be formally trained in the process of collaborative and responsible research including ethics, teamwork and leadership. The program will also help the students to improve their communication abilities and writing skills through activities such as oral presentations and technical reports.  Through this program, the students will be empowered with research skills and experience to empower their journey to become successful researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

The REU program hosted 28 undergraduate students to engage in research projects during the summer. The students got motivated and mentored through various research projects so that they can make good preparations for pursuing advanced degrees and careers in STEM-related areas. The program offers a 10-week summer program to provide a hands-on research and educational experience to undergraduate students per year in the area of AI and machine learning with an emphasis on hardware-software co-design. 35% of the participants came from underrepresented groups such as women and Latinx communities. 39% of participants came from institutions with no graduate research programs related to AI. 6 students came from institutions without graduate programs in computer science. 53% of participants joined as freshman or sophomore students. Nearly all students had no previous experience engaging in research activities at their own institutions and had little knowledge of AI and machine learning. During the time of this award, program operations were continuously evaluated and updated in order to improve the research experience for the participants. By the time this award ends, all participants have gained valuable research experience in AI and machine learning and are on track to embark on successful careers in STEM.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p> <p>This REU project helped introduce AI and machine learning knowledge to undergraduate students who are eager to learn AI related technologies and want to pursue a career in this field.

Each student was assigned to a team and trained by their mentor and graduate assistants to develop their own machine learning-based solution to the problems they are interested in, including image processing, DNA classification, environment protection, disease detection, particle identification in physics, etc. Students were guided through the research process of defining and characterizing a problem, developing novel solution and evaluating the results. This procedure involves one-on-one mentoring from faculty, technical support from graduate assistants and peer discussion.
