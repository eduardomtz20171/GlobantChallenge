<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site award to the University of Wyoming (UW), located in Laramie WY, will bring seven community college (CC) students and two CC professors to UW each summer from 2021 to 2023. This program, jointly supported by the Division of Chemistry and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), will allow students and faculty to contribute to chemistry research on projects ranging from energy, to  materials, to bio-related topics. Each student will work closely with one of the participating faculty mentors who have been carefully selected for their research accomplishments and successful mentoring records with undergraduate researchers. This hands-on research experience also includes a variety of activities (seminars, mini-courses on ethics and writing, and energy-related field trips) to educate and train students for their future careers as scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The higher education system in Wyoming is comprised of a single 4-year/graduate level university along with seven community colleges. This REU site emphasizes serving students and faculty from regional CCs to positively impact students and science in WY and surrounding states. This program will engage first and second-year undergraduates, who are early in their college career, and expose them to graduate level chemistry research. The wide range of projects offered includes the synthesis and characterization of nanoparticule-based catalysts; site-selective photochemical protein modification; and the chemistry of molecular hydrogen quantum crystals. On this latter project, it is worthy of note that cryogenic solid molecular hydrogen is a unique condensed phase environment due to a variety of quantum mechanical effects such as large amplitude translational zero point motion of the individual H molecules and the presence of ortho and para nuclear spin manifolds.  A variety of non-classical dynamics occur within such crystals at liquid helium temperatures. These research experiences will provide a more in-depth view of chemistry research and of perspective on potential job opportunities in the chemical sciences. The students in this program will also have opportunities for professional development including training in ethics, scientific communication, and preparation of resumes and graduate school application materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) award supported 27 students and 1 faculty member from community colleges in the Wyoming region including Wyoming, Idaho, and Colorado. This program focused on introducing community college students and faculty to graduate research labs at the University of Wyoming and allowing them hands on experience the labs including instrumentation, equipment, and techniques that are typically not available at their home institutions. As part of this award, the PIs also visited community colleges across the state to disseminate the research findings of previous participants and recruit new students into the program. The participants of this program took part in weekly professional development training workshops including ethics, scientific communication, and preparation of resumes and graduate school application materials. Further, the participants traveled to several energy related scientific locations including national labs [National renewable energy lab (NREL), Idaho national lab (INL)], a wind farm, a solar installation, and an in-situ uranium recovery mine. These sites each featured unique experiences showcasing the many ways chemical research impacts their daily lives and primarily focused on energy generation which is easily relatable for all students. In addition, these sites demonstrated potential jobs in STEM fields that are in or near Wyoming which provided further motivation for students to stay in scientific majors for their terminal degrees. Most of the participants of this award have completed their associates degrees at their home institutions and matriculated to a bachelor&rsquo;s program in a STEM field. In addition, some participants from previous funding cycles, have gone onto advanced degrees (MS or PhD) in chemistry and chemical engineering further demonstrating the success of this program at introducing students to scientific research and a pathway for success in STEM fields.</p><br> <p>  Last Modified: 09/03/2024<br> Modified by: Brian&nbsp;Leonard</p></div> <div class="porSideCol" ><div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)          </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2051148/2051148_10720298_1725340626665_PXL_20220718_162848811.MP--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2051148/2051148_10720298_1725340626665_PXL_20220718_162848811.MP--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Wyoming REU tours NREL"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2051148/2051148_10720298_1725340626665_PXL_20220718_162848811.MP--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Wyoming REU tours NREL"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">University of Wyoming REU participants visited the National Renewable Energy Lab and toured their campuses including the wind energy development site</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brian Leonard</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Brian&nbsp;Leonard <div class="imageTitle">Wyoming REU tours NREL</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2051148/2051148_10720298_1725340462265_PXL_20220622_191420389.MP--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2051148/2051148_10720298_1725340462265_PXL_20220622_191420389.MP--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Wyoming REU Visit Uranium Mine"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2051148/2051148_10720298_1725340462265_PXL_20220622_191420389.MP--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Wyoming REU Visit Uranium Mine"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">University of Wyoming REU participants toured an in-situ uranium recovery mine in Wyoming</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brian Leonard</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Brian&nbsp;Leonard <div class="imageTitle">Wyoming REU Visit Uranium Mine</div> </div> </li><li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2051148/2051148_10720298_1725340344099_IMG_6689--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2051148/2051148_10720298_1725340344099_IMG_6689--rgov-800width.jpg" title="INL Tour 2023"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/2051148/2051148_10720298_1725340344099_IMG_6689--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="INL Tour 2023"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">University of Wyoming REU participants touring the Advanced Test Reactor at Idaho National Labs</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brian Leonard</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Brian&nbsp;Leonard <div class="imageTitle">INL Tour 2023</div> </div> </li></ul> </div> </div></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
