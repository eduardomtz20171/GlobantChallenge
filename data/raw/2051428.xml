<AbstractNarration>This award will support a series of three workshops to be held in conjunction with the annual meetings of the Society for the Study of Evolution (19 June 2020, Cleveland, OH), the Botanical Society of American (18 July 2020, Anchorage, AK) and the Ecological Society of America (9 August 2020, Salt Lake City, UT). The purpose of the workshops is to educate the research community about the Project Baseline seed bank resource which was designed specifically to facilitate investigations into the evolutionary and ecological consequences of climate and other ecosystem changes by collecting from multiple geographically diverse locations per species and maintaining seeds by maternal line. Without an active effort to disseminate information about Project Baseline, it may not be used to its full potential.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;These three workshops will include a description of the available resources; examples of recent resurrection studies; the development of guidelines for using seeds; and opportunities for collaborative small-group discussion. The workshops will emphasize participation by early-career scientists, who are well situated to use and add to the seed bank over the coming decades, and to eventually oversee its stewardship. Products from the proposed workshops will include: best practices for using and maintaining Project Baseline; literature demonstrating the uses of Project Baseline seeds; a database of potential funding sources for research and future collections; a Project Baseline presentation; and an opportunity to develop a network of research collaborators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The NSF-funded Project Baseline seedbank has amassed a critical genetic resource to explicitly address questions about temporal and spatial patterns of evolution. The seedbank comprises over 10 million seeds from 65 plant taxa, collected from over 270 sites across the contiguous United States and stored at the National Laboratory for Genetic Resources Preservation. For each taxon, sampling was conducted across multiple populations, with an average of 103 maternal families per population, resulting in over 100,000 maternal lines for experimental studies. The Project Baseline Informational Workshop grant aimed to raise awareness about this valuable collection and availability to researchers across the scientific community, and to stimulate discussions about projects that that could use the Project Baseline seedbank. To achieve these goals, workshops were hosted both virtually and in-person, and significant updates were made to the seedbank databases and webpage. First, a three-part virtual workshop was hosted in Fall 2021, reaching a broad and diverse audience of primarily early career researchers. Over 120 participants registered for the workshops to participate asynchronously or synchronously. A key element of these workshops included example research studies, including a pilot study facilitated by the Project Baseline seedbank. In addition, working luncheons were hosted in conjunction with two conferences in Summer 2022, the Society for the Study of Evolution (Cleveland, OH) and the Botanical Society of America (Anchorage, AK). Over two dozen participants took part in the luncheons, primarily consisting of early career researchers. Researchers spent time networking, forming working groups, and formulating project ideas to use the collections. Importantly, researchers also learned how to use the Project Baseline databases, and how to make requests to access the seed collection.
