<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be in protecting natural and commercial resources as a result of actionable information on invasive insect pest.   The information will be used by local, state and federal agencies to monitor harmful pests in real time and to plan optimal intervention strategies. Invasive species affect vulnerable communities in poor rural areas, who depend on natural resources, healthy ecosystems, and tourism for their livelihoods. Invasive insect pests can drive food insecurity and undermine ongoing investments in development. There is a growing consensus that early detection and rapid response is the best solution, but early detection is challenging for want of robust, automatic surveillance systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will investigate problems at the intersection of entomology and engineering to improve the accuracy and reliability of autonomous insect traps. New classification models will be created to allow application to a more diverse set of insects. Novel “cold start” algorithms will be created to allow the classification of new species without first obtaining detailed training data.  The project will create a scheduling system for trap servicing that dynamically considers the probabilistic insect classification/counts from thousands of traps and the location of a fleet of trap technicians (in their service trucks), in order to compute the optimal trap-to-technician assignment and order of visitation. These algorithms generalize fleet dispatch algorithms to consider the probabilistic nature of the classification and different costs of damage created by different insects. The proposed innovation of this project will lie in de-skilling the invasive species monitoring task, decreasing its cost, and reducing the lag between an insect species’ arrival and its (human) detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project investigated the creation of an end-to-end digital system for invasive insect species surveillance. Across the USA (and the world), agriculture, forests, and public lands are in danger from the accidental introduction of invasive insect pests. In their native habitat, these insects may be controlled by predators, weather conditions or limited resources, but upon invasion there may be little to keep them in check. Examples include the Spotted Lanternfly which is native to China and was first detected in the USA in 2014. With no native predator in the USA, the Spotted Lanternfly is a major plant stressor and a significant concern to the timber and ornamental industries. Another example is the Japanese Beetle, which are only a minor nuisance in Japan, but cause over a half billion dollars of damage each year in the USA. Even a small county like San Diego must deploy 10,000 plus Japanese Beetle traps, which must be manually inspected at least every two weeks. This manual inspection requires a team of thirty or more full-time trap technicians to drive hundreds of thousands of miles each year.

Because the sensor can recognize the species of insects it encounters, it can discount the arrival of native and innocuous insects but sound an alarm when it encounters either a known invasive pest, or an unknown species. Moreover, by using a "cocktail" of attractants, just a single trap can monitor multiple species of targeted insects. Because our insect sensors can classify the arriving insects down to species level, there is no danger of confusing an innocuous native insect for an invasive pest. Our system uses these digital encounters with insects to direct the trap technicians to service the traps that are most likely to have a targeted insect, making their inspection routes much more efficient, and allowing them to detect invasive pests with minimal time delays, and reducing their driving time.<br />To create such a system, this project investigated problems at the intersection of entomology and engineering (the emerging field of &nbsp;"Computational Entomology") to improve the accuracy and reliability of autonomous insect traps, and the actionability of the data they produce.
