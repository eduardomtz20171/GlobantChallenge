<AbstractNarration><![CDATA[This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2). Dr. Christopher Schiller has been awarded an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to conduct research, professional development, and outreach activities at the University of Washington and Boise State University under the mentorship of Drs. Caroline Stromberg and Mark D. Schmitz, respectively. Understanding the Earth system under climates warmer than today is a useful approach for understanding the consequences of future warming resulting from human-caused climate change. One such warm period in the Earth’s history is the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO), approximately 17-14 million years ago, when global temperatures were 4-7°C warmer than the modern, pre-industrial period. Fossil plant assemblages from the MMCO have been used to understand how the climate and ecosystems of that time functioned on long (millions of years) timescales. However, the importance of climate and ecosystem processes that function on shorter (hundreds of thousands of years and shorter) timescales has not often been considered. New research has suggested that climate change on short timescales and large, frequent volcanic eruptions may have greatly affected MMCO ecosystems. Therefore, it becomes unclear if ecosystem changes seen in fossil plant assemblages are representative of long-term climate conditions or a response to short-term processes. This study of MMCO vegetation in the Pacific Northwest aims to understand the cause of ecosystem change seen in fossil plants. Fossil pollen assemblages will be studied to examine ecosystem change over short timescales and if climate, fire, or volcanic eruptions may have caused those changes. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project will examine two mid-Miocene paleofloras in Oregon, the Succor Creek Flora and Mascall Flora, from which short-term (high-resolution) vegetation states will be reconstructed from pollen and contemporaneous ecological disturbances of several types will be constructed from charcoal (fire), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (fire), elemental geochemistry (landscape stability), and detailed lithological descriptions (landscape stability and volcanic eruptions). Short-term records will be compared with long-term (coarse-resolution) vegetation records, which will be produced from longer stratigraphic sections from the same floras and Miocene-length records produced from a concurrent project (EAR-1924390). Suites of U-Pb zircon dates from each flora will allow for a robust chronology for all vegetation-disturbance reconstructions and enable correlation with insolation solutions and marine climate records. This project will contribute a modern examination of the understudied field of pre-Quaternary palynology, an investigation of the response of vegetation to a past period of dramatic climate change and intense volcanism, and an application of multiple proxies to understand MMCO ecosystem function, and mentorship of undergraduate science students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.]]></AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award provided funding for the reconstruction of vegetation and disturbance mechanisms from the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO, approx. 16.9-14.7 million years ago), the most recent period of sustained warming in Earth history. The MCO was characterized by global temperatures 4-7 deg. C warmer than pre-industrial conditions, similar to the direst projections for end-of-century anthropogenic warming. Overlaid on this pattern of warming are a series of short-lived hyperthermal events (atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations potentially varying from 300-500 ppm) and frequent, severe volcanic eruptions. This project, Mid-Miocene climate, vegetation, and disturbance dynamics of the Pacific Northwest, set out to determine: (1) Did MCO vegetation vary over short periods (thousands to hundreds of thousands of years) such that the impact of long-term (millions of years) climate change was obscured?

Many of these vegetation shifts were abrupt and co-occur with thick volcanic ashes, suggesting that volcanic disturbance was a primary driver of vegetation change at Sucker Creek. By contrast, fossil pollen from the Clarkia lakebeds were consistently dominated by a cool-temperate broadleaved forest (chestnut, oak), with more gradual changes in vegetation occurring over approx. 100-thousand-year intervals. This pace of vegetation change suggests that short-term climate change associated with changes to Earth&rsquo;s orbit was the primary driver at Clarkia. Comparisons between Sucker Creek, Clarkia, and other minor fossil pollen localities show that MCO ecosystems were constantly changing on multiple timescales in response to multiple factors.
