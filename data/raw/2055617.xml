<AbstractNarration>The goal of the project is to develop further the mathematical tools needed in the study of fundamental questions in nonlinear partial differential equations, calculus of variations, and free boundary problems. These questions have their origins in the applied sciences like elasticity, fluid mechanics, or cost optimization, and are relevant in areas of pure mathematics like geometry. The theoretical aspects of these models are important towards a better understanding of basic physical phenomena and could be useful for the larger scientific community. The project provides research training opportunities for students and its outcomes will be broadly disseminated to diverse audiences.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator (PI) will study several questions related to the classical obstacle problem. One of them concerns the multiple membrane problem, which describes the interaction of N elastic membranes in contact with each other. Mathematically, it can be viewed as a coupled system of obstacle problems with N-1 interacting free boundaries. Another question to be addressed deals with the uniqueness of certain blow-up cones for the thin obstacle problem, also known as the Signorini problem. An important part of the project considers the optimal transportation problem for quadratic costs with densities that vanish on the boundary of their support. This problem is equivalent to the second boundary value problem for a highly degenerate Monge-Amp√®re equation. The PI also aims to understand the interior regularity of minimizing maps in the calculus of variations for one of the simplest polyconvex energies in two dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The project focused on various questions about regularity of solutions to elliptic PDEs which arise in free boundary problems, the calculus of variations, and geometry.   The PI developed novel methods in a few problems of interest. A free boundary problem studied was a vectorial version of the obstacle problem in the setting of several elastic membranes in contact with one another. The regularity of this system of interacting free boundaries is particularly challenging since they can intersect and cross each other in complicated ways. In a related project the PI developed the theory of harmonic functions with junctions which considers a similar situation of interacting free boundaries in the context of the Bernoulli free boundary problem.   Another part of the project focused on developing the regularity theory for minimizers of the Alt-Phillips energy of negative exponents. For positive exponents this family of problems interpolate between the classical obstacle problem and the Bernoulli free boundary problem. The case of negative exponents is more difficult due to the singular behavior of solutions near their free boundary. The PI showed that the family of problems with negative exponents interpolate further between the Bernoulli problem and the sets with minimal perimeter.   The PI developed some new ideas to establish   a) the uniqueness of tangent cones in the Signorini problem at certain highly singular points of the free boundary;   b) the sharp behavior of graphical nonlocal minimal surfaces in domains with corners;   c) global estimates for certain degenerate Monge-Ampere equations;   d) the existence of solutions the the Special Lagrangian equation with non minimal graphs.   The results achieved in this project have been disseminated to the scientific community through participation to conferences and seminars. They also opened up several future directions of research.        Last Modified: 10/29/2024       Submitted by: OvidiuSavin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
